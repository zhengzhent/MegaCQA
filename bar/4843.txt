--------------------------------------------------
Model: Qwen/Qwen2.5-VL-72B-Instruct
Readability Score: 4/5
Score Reason: The chart is well-organized with clear labels for each energy source. The use of a consistent pattern for the bars helps in distinguishing them from the background. The values are directly labeled on the bars, which makes it easy to read the exact consumption figures. The x-axis is clearly marked with TWh, and the title provides context for the data. However, the chart could be improved by using color to differentiate between the energy sources for better visual distinction.

Model: gpt-4o-mini
Readability Score: 4/5
Score Reason: The visualization effectively uses horizontal bars to represent energy consumption across different sources, making it easy to compare values. The labels are clear, and the scale is well-defined. However, the use of a grid pattern within the bars may slightly detract from the overall clarity, but it does not significantly hinder readability.
