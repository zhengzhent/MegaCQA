Model: gpt-4o-mini
Readability Score: 4/5
Score Reason: The visualization effectively uses a horizontal bar chart to display R&D investment across cities, making it easy to compare values. The colors are distinct and help differentiate the cities, while the labels are clear and readable. However, the chart could benefit from a more consistent color scheme and a clearer title placement to enhance overall clarity.
