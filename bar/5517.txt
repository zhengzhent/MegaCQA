Model: Qwen/Qwen2.5-VL-72B-Instruct
Readability Score: 4/5
Score Reason: The chart is well-organized with clear labels for each food category and the corresponding sales figures. The use of a consistent pattern (stars) within the bars helps in distinguishing them from the background. The values are directly written on top of each bar, which makes it easy to read the exact sales figures. The title and axis labels are clear and informative.

Model: gpt-4o-mini
Readability Score: 4/5
Score Reason: The chart presents a clear comparison of sales figures across different food categories. The use of a bar chart is appropriate for this type of data, and the labels for both the y-axis and x-axis are clearly defined. However, the star pattern within the bars may distract from the actual data values, making it slightly harder to read at a glance. Overall, the chart is mostly readable but could be improved by simplifying the bar design.
