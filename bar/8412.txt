Readability Score: 4/5
Score Reason: The visualization presents the data in a clear bar chart format, with distinct colors for each type of house, making it easy to differentiate between them. The labels are legible, and the values are clearly indicated at the end of each bar. However, the chart could benefit from a more organized layout, as some bars are quite close together, which may lead to minor confusion. Overall, it is still quite readable.
