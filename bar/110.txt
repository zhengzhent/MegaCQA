Model: Qwen/Qwen2.5-VL-72B-Instruct
Readability Score: 4/5
Score Reason: The chart is well-organized with clear labels and a straightforward layout.

The title and axis labels are clear and informative.

Model: gpt-4o-mini
Readability Score: 4/5
Score Reason: The visualization effectively uses horizontal bars to represent the production of different crops, making it easy to compare values at a glance. The labels are clear, and the metric tons scale is well-defined. However, the use of hatched patterns instead of solid colors may slightly hinder quick interpretation, but overall, the chart remains quite readable.
