Model: gpt-4o-mini
Readability Score: 4/5
Score Reason: The visualization effectively uses horizontal bars to represent the number of plays across different platforms, making it easy to compare values. The color differentiation is clear, and the labels are legible. However, the chart could benefit from a more consistent color scheme and clearer labeling of the axes to enhance readability further.
