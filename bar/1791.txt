Model: Qwen/Qwen2.5-VL-72B-Instruct
Readability Score: 4/5
Score Reason: The chart is clear and well-organized, with each company's revenue data presented in a bar format. The use of consistent patterns on the bars helps in distinguishing them from the background. The labels for both the x-axis and y-axis are legible, and the revenue values are directly written on top of each bar, making it easy to understand the data at a glance. However, the bars are closely packed, which might make it slightly challenging to compare the exact values of adjacent bars.

Model: gpt-4o-mini
Readability Score: 4/5
Score Reason: The visualization presents the annual revenue data clearly with distinct bars for each company. However, the use of diagonal lines within the bars may distract from the actual values, making it slightly harder to read. The labels are legible, and the overall structure is organized, but the diagonal pattern could be simplified for better clarity.
