Model: Qwen/Qwen2.5-VL-72B-Instruct
Readability Score: 4/5
Score Reason: The chart is straightforward and easy to interpret. The bars are clearly labeled with the farm names and the corresponding values in tons. The use of a consistent pattern for the bars maintains uniformity, and the title clearly states the purpose of the chart. The scale on the y-axis is appropriate for the data range, and the x-axis labels are legible.

Model: gpt-4o-mini
Readability Score: 4/5
Score Reason: The chart effectively presents the data with clear labels for each farm and corresponding values displayed on top of the bars. However, the use of diagonal hatching for the bars may reduce clarity, especially in distinguishing between the different farms. The overall layout is straightforward, but the hatching could be simplified for better readability.
