Model: Qwen/Qwen2.5-VL-72B-Instruct
Readability Score: 5/5
Score Reason: The chart is clear and well-organized, with each bar representing a different farm's fruit transportation flow in tons. The use of a gradient color scheme adds visual interest without detracting from the data. The labels are legible, and the values are directly placed on top of each bar, making it easy to understand the exact quantities. The title and axis labels are clear and informative.

Model: gpt-4o-mini
Readability Score: 4/5
Score Reason: The visualization effectively uses a bar chart format to display the fruit transportation flow from different farms. The bars are clearly labeled with the corresponding values, making it easy to compare the data. However, the grayscale color scheme may reduce visual contrast, making it slightly harder to distinguish between the bars, especially for viewers with color vision deficiencies. Overall, the chart is mostly clear and interpretable.
