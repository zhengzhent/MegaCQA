Model: Qwen/Qwen2.5-VL-72B-Instruct
Readability Score: 4/5
Score Reason: The chart is straightforward and uses a simple bar graph format, which is easy to interpret. The bars are clearly labeled with both the city names and the corresponding numbers of artworks. The use of diagonal lines for shading adds a visual element without cluttering the chart. The scale on the y-axis is appropriate for the data range, and the title clearly states the purpose of the chart.

Model: gpt-4o-mini
Readability Score: 4/5
Score Reason: The chart effectively presents the number of artworks created across different cities with clear labels and a straightforward bar format. The use of distinct bars for each city allows for easy comparison, and the numerical values on top of the bars enhance clarity. However, the hatched pattern may slightly reduce visual clarity compared to solid colors, but overall, the readability remains high.
