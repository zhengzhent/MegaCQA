Model: Qwen/Qwen2.5-VL-72B-Instruct
Readability Score: 4/5
Score Reason: The chart is clear and well-organized, with distinct bars for each company's revenue. The use of a gradient color scheme adds visual interest without detracting from the data. The labels are legible, and the values are directly placed on top of each bar, making it easy to understand the revenue figures at a glance. The title and axis labels are clear and informative.

Model: gpt-4o-mini
Readability Score: 4/5
Score Reason: The visualization effectively uses a simple bar chart format to present the annual revenue data of different companies. The labels are clear, and the values are displayed on the bars, making it easy to compare the revenues at a glance. However, the use of a monochromatic color scheme may reduce visual appeal and differentiation between bars, but it does not significantly hinder readability.
