Model: Qwen/Qwen2.5-VL-72B-Instruct
Readability Score: 4/5
Score Reason: The chart uses a clear bar format with distinct labels for each month and corresponding sales figures. The use of diagonal lines within the bars adds a unique visual element but does not detract from readability. The values are directly placed at the end of each bar, making it easy to read the exact figures. However, the months are not in chronological order, which might cause a slight confusion for the reader.

Model: gpt-4o-mini
Readability Score: 3/5
Score Reason: The visualization presents the monthly online sales figures clearly, with distinct bars for each month. However, the use of diagonal lines within the bars may hinder quick interpretation of the values. The labels are legible, but the overall design could be simplified for better readability.
