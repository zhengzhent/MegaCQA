Readability Score: 4/5
Score Reason: The visualization effectively uses horizontal bars to represent the number of employees in different companies, making it easy to compare values at a glance. The color differentiation is clear, and the labels are legible. However, the chart could benefit from a more consistent color scheme and better alignment of the company names to enhance readability further.
