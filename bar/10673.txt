Model: Qwen/Qwen2.5-VL-72B-Instruct
Readability Score: 4/5
Score Reason: The chart is clear and straightforward, with each city's R&D investment easily identifiable. The use of a bar chart is appropriate for comparing values across different categories. The labels are legible, and the values are directly written on top of each bar, which enhances readability. The grid pattern on the bars does not distract from the data.

Model: gpt-4o-mini
Readability Score: 4/5
Score Reason: The chart presents the data clearly with labeled axes and distinct bars for each city. However, the use of a grid pattern within the bars may distract from the actual values, making it slightly harder to read the exact figures. The overall layout is straightforward, but the grid pattern could be simplified for better clarity.
