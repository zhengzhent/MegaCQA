Model: Qwen/Qwen2.5-VL-72B-Instruct
Readability Score: 4/5
Score Reason: The chart is clear and easy to interpret. Each bar is distinctly colored, and the values are labeled directly on the bars, making it easy to read the exact figures. The months are clearly marked on the x-axis, and the y-axis is labeled with a clear unit (thousand USD). The title provides context for the data being presented. However, the months are not in chronological order, which might cause a slight confusion for the reader.
