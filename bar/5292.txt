Model: Qwen/Qwen2.5-VL-72B-Instruct
Readability Score: 4/5
Score Reason: The chart uses a clear and consistent pattern with stars to represent sales figures, which is visually engaging. The labels for food categories and the scale are legible, and the values are directly indicated at the end of each bar, making it easy to understand the sales figures at a glance. However, the use of stars instead of a solid fill might be slightly less intuitive for some viewers compared to traditional bar charts.

Model: gpt-4o-mini
Readability Score: 2/5
Score Reason: The visualization uses star symbols to represent sales figures, which may not be the most effective way to convey numerical data. The lack of color differentiation and the crowded appearance of the stars can make it difficult for viewers to quickly interpret the values. Additionally, the scale on the x-axis is not clearly marked, which can lead to confusion regarding the exact sales figures.
