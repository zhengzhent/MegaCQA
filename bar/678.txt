Model: Qwen/Qwen2.5-VL-72B-Instruct
Readability Score: 4/5
Score Reason: The chart is straightforward and uses a clear bar graph format. The bars are evenly spaced, and the values are directly labeled on top of each bar, making it easy to compare the production of different crops. The use of a single pattern for all bars maintains simplicity, and the axis labels are clear and legible.

Model: gpt-4o-mini
Readability Score: 4/5
Score Reason: The chart presents the data clearly with labeled bars for each crop category, and the values are displayed directly on the bars, making it easy to read. However, the use of diagonal lines in the bars may slightly detract from clarity, but overall, the information is still easily interpretable.
