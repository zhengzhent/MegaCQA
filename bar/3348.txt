Model: gpt-4o-mini
Readability Score: 4/5
Score Reason: The visualization effectively uses horizontal bars to compare the number of students in different cities, which is easy to interpret. The color gradient is visually appealing, but it may slightly hinder quick comparisons due to the lack of distinct color differentiation. However, the labels and values are clear and legible, making the overall readability quite good.
