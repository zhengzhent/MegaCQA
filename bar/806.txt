Model: gpt-4o-mini
Readability Score: 4/5
Score Reason: The visualization effectively uses a horizontal bar chart format, which is suitable for comparing the production of different crops. The color gradient helps to differentiate the bars, and the labels are clear and easy to read. However, the background color could be improved for better contrast with the text. Overall, the information is presented in a straightforward manner, making it relatively easy to interpret.
