Model: Qwen/Qwen2.5-VL-72B-Instruct
Readability Score: 4/5
Score Reason: The chart is straightforward with clear labels and distinct colors for each bar, making it easy to differentiate between the months. The values are directly written on top of each bar, which aids in quick comprehension. However, the x-axis only shows three months, which might not provide a complete picture of the sales trend throughout the year.

Readability Score: 4/5
Score Reason: The chart effectively presents the monthly online sales figures with clear labels for each month and corresponding sales values. The use of distinct colors for each bar enhances visual differentiation, and the y-axis is appropriately scaled. However, the title could be more concise, and the font size for the values on the bars could be slightly larger for better readability. Overall, the visualization is quite clear and easy to interpret.
