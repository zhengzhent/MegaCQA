Model: gpt-4o-mini
Readability Score: 4/5
Score Reason: The chart effectively presents the comparison of student numbers across different cities with clear bar representations. However, the x-axis labels are tilted, which may hinder readability for some viewers. The color differentiation is good, but the overall layout could be improved for better clarity.
