Model: gpt-4o-mini
Readability Score: 4/5
Score Reason: The visualization effectively uses horizontal bars to represent energy consumption for different sources, making it easy to compare values at a glance. The color differentiation is clear, and the labels are legible. However, the lack of a clear title for the y-axis could lead to some confusion about what the bars represent, but overall, the chart is still quite readable.
