Model: Qwen/Qwen2.5-VL-72B-Instruct
Readability Score: 4/5
Score Reason: The chart is straightforward and uses a clear bar graph format to display annual revenue data. The labels for both the x-axis and y-axis are legible, and the revenue values are directly written on top of each bar, making it easy to understand the data at a glance. The use of grid lines within the bars does not distract from the data but rather helps in visual estimation. However, the bars are quite close together, which might make it slightly challenging to distinguish between them for some viewers.
