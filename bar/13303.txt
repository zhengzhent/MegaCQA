Model: Qwen/Qwen2.5-VL-72B-Instruct
Readability Score: 4/5
Score Reason: The chart is straightforward and uses clear labels for both the x-axis and y-axis. The bars are distinct and the values are directly labeled on top of each bar, making it easy to compare the number of visitors for each attraction. The use of a consistent pattern for the bars maintains uniformity without introducing unnecessary complexity.

Model: gpt-4o-mini
Readability Score: 3/5
Score Reason: The chart effectively communicates the annual visitors to different attractions, but the use of diagonal hatching makes it difficult to distinguish between the bars. Additionally, the labels for the attractions are angled, which may hinder readability. The scale is clear, but the overall presentation could be improved for better clarity.
