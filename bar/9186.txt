Model: Qwen/Qwen2.5-VL-72B-Instruct
Readability Score: 4/5
Score Reason: The chart is relatively clear with distinct bars and labeled values, making it easy to compare monthly sales. However, the months are not in chronological order, which can be confusing. The use of diagonal lines for shading is consistent but does not add much to the readability. The title and axis labels are clear and informative.

Model: gpt-4o-mini
Readability Score: 3/5
Score Reason: The chart presents the monthly online sales figures clearly, with distinct bars for each month. However, the use of diagonal lines within the bars may distract from the actual values, and the numbers on top of the bars could be difficult to read due to their size and placement. Overall, while the information is accessible, the visual design could be improved for better clarity.
