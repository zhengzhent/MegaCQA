Model: Qwen/Qwen2.5-VL-72B-Instruct
Readability Score: 4/5
Score Reason: The chart is clear and well-organized, with each bar representing a different video sharing platform. The use of consistent patterns on the bars helps in distinguishing them from one another. The labels are legible, and the values are clearly marked on top of each bar, making it easy to compare the number of plays across platforms. The title and axis labels are descriptive and help in understanding the context of the data.

Model: gpt-4o-mini
Readability Score: 4/5
Score Reason: The chart presents the data clearly with distinct bars for each platform, and the values are labeled directly on the bars, making it easy to read. However, the diagonal lines on the bars may slightly detract from clarity, but overall, the visualization is still quite effective.
