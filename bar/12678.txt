Model: Qwen/Qwen2.5-VL-72B-Instruct
Readability Score: 4/5
Score Reason: The chart is straightforward and uses a clear bar graph format to represent the box office earnings of different movies. The bars are labeled with their respective values, making it easy to compare the earnings at a glance. The use of a consistent pattern for all bars maintains uniformity, and the axis labels are clear and legible. However, the title could be more specific to avoid any ambiguity about the currency and the type of data being represented.

Model: gpt-4o-mini
Readability Score: 4/5
Score Reason: The chart presents the box office earnings of different movies clearly, with distinct bars for each movie. However, the use of hatch patterns instead of solid colors makes it slightly harder to differentiate between the bars at a glance. The labels and values are legible, but the overall visual impact could be improved with better color contrast. Overall, it is still relatively easy to interpret the data.
