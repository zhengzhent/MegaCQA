Model: Qwen/Qwen2.5-VL-72B-Instruct
Readability Score: 4/5
Score Reason: The chart is clear and well-organized, with each bar representing a month's sales figures. The use of a gradient color scheme adds visual interest without detracting from the data. The labels are legible, and the values are directly placed on top of each bar, making it easy to read the exact figures. The title and axis labels are clear and informative.

Model: gpt-4o-mini
Readability Score: 4/5
Score Reason: The chart effectively uses a clear color gradient to represent sales figures, and the labels for months and values are legible. However, the color scheme may not provide enough contrast for some viewers, and the values are placed on the bars, which could lead to confusion if the viewer is not careful. Overall, it is fairly readable but could be improved.
