Model: gpt-4o-mini
Readability Score: 4/5
Score Reason: The chart presents the data in a clear bar format, with distinct labels for each city and corresponding values displayed on top of the bars. However, the use of diagonal lines in the bars may slightly hinder readability, as it can make it harder to quickly assess the height of each bar. Overall, the chart is still quite understandable and conveys the information effectively.
