Model: Qwen/Qwen2.5-VL-72B-Instruct
Readability Score: 4/5
Score Reason: The chart is straightforward and easy to interpret. The bars are clearly labeled with the number of visitors, and the use of a gradient color adds visual interest without detracting from the data. The title and axis labels are clear and provide context for the data being presented.

Model: gpt-4o-mini
Readability Score: 4/5
Score Reason: The visualization effectively uses a simple bar chart format to display the number of visitors to different attractions. The labels for each attraction and the corresponding visitor numbers are clearly visible. However, the gradient color scheme may cause some difficulty in quickly assessing the heights of the bars, and the x-axis labels are slightly tilted, which could affect readability. Overall, it is fairly easy to interpret the data.
