Model: Qwen/Qwen2.5-VL-72B-Instruct
Readability Score: 4/5
Score Reason: The chart is clear and well-organized, with each energy source distinctly labeled on the x-axis and corresponding TWh values on the y-axis. The use of consistent bar patterns and direct labeling of values on top of each bar enhances readability. The title clearly states the context of the data, making it easy for the viewer to understand the purpose of the visualization.

Model: gpt-4o-mini
Readability Score: 4/5
Score Reason: The visualization presents a clear comparison of energy consumption across different sources with well-defined bars and labels. The use of a consistent scale on the y-axis and clear labeling of each energy source enhances readability. However, the diagonal lines in the bars may slightly distract from the numerical values, but overall, the chart is easy to interpret.
