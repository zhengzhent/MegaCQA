Readability Score: 4/5
Score Reason: The chart is clear and well-organized, with each bar representing a different movie's box office earnings. The use of consistent patterns on the bars helps in distinguishing them from the background. The labels for both the x-axis and y-axis are legible, and the values are clearly marked on top of each bar, making it easy to understand the box office performance of each movie at a glance.

Model: gpt-4o-mini
Readability Score: 4/5
Score Reason: The visualization effectively presents the box office earnings of different movies with clear labels and a straightforward bar chart format. The use of distinct bars for each movie allows for easy comparison, and the values are clearly displayed on top of the bars. However, the diagonal lines in the bars may slightly detract from the overall clarity, but they do not significantly hinder readability.
