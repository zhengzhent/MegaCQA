Model: gpt-4o-mini
Readability Score: 4/5
Score Reason: The visualization effectively uses a horizontal bar chart to display the annual revenue data of different companies. The labels are clear, and the revenue figures are easily readable. The scale is appropriately marked, allowing for quick comparisons between the companies. However, the spacing between the bars could be improved for better visual separation, but overall, it remains quite readable.
