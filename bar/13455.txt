--------------------------------------------------
Model: Qwen/Qwen2.5-VL-72B-Instruct
Readability Score: 4/5
Score Reason: The chart is clear and well-organized, with each bar representing a different attraction and the number of visitors. The use of stars as a pattern in the bars adds visual interest without detracting from the data. The labels are legible, and the values are clearly marked on top of each bar, making it easy to compare the number of visitors across attractions.

Model: gpt-4o-mini
Readability Score: 2/5
Score Reason: The visualization uses a unique star pattern for the bars, which may distract from the actual data values. The numbers on top of the bars are somewhat legible, but the overall design is cluttered and unconventional for a bar chart, making it harder for viewers to quickly interpret the data. Additionally, the y-axis labels could be clearer, and the use of a non-standard bar fill may confuse readers.
