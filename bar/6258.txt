--------------------------------------------------
Model: Qwen/Qwen2.5-VL-72B-Instruct
Readability Score: 5/5
Score Reason: The bar chart is clear and well-organized, with each bar representing a town and its corresponding number of hospital visits. The use of a gradient color scheme adds visual interest without detracting from the data. The labels for both the x-axis (town names) and y-axis (number of visits) are legible, and the values are directly written on top of each bar, making it easy to read the exact numbers. The title is descriptive and provides context for the data.

Model: gpt-4o-mini
Readability Score: 4/5
Score Reason: The visualization effectively uses a bar chart to represent the data on hospital visits, with clear labels for each town and corresponding visit numbers. The gradient color scheme is visually appealing, but it may slightly hinder quick comparisons between bars. However, the overall layout is organized, and the data is easy to interpret, making it relatively readable.
