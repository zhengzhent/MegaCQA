--------------------------------------------------
Model: Qwen/Qwen2.5-VL-72B-Instruct
Readability Score: 4/5
Score Reason: The chart is clear and well-organized, with each bar representing a different video sharing platform. The use of a grid pattern within the bars adds a visual texture but does not detract from readability. The labels for both the x-axis and y-axis are legible, and the values are clearly marked on top of each bar, making it easy to compare the number of plays across platforms. The title is descriptive and provides context for the data presented.

Model: gpt-4o-mini
Readability Score: 4/5
Score Reason: The chart effectively presents the number of plays across different platforms with clear labels and a straightforward layout. The use of a bar chart is appropriate for comparing values, and the numerical values on top of each bar enhance clarity. However, the grid lines and the pattern fill in the bars may create some visual clutter, slightly affecting readability. Overall, it is still easy to interpret the data.
