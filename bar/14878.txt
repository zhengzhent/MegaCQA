Readability Score: 4/5
Score Reason: The chart is clear and well-organized, with each bar representing a different farm's fruit transportation flow in tons. The use of consistent patterns and clear labels makes it easy to distinguish between farms. The values are directly written on top of each bar, which aids in quick comprehension. The title and axis labels are also clear and informative.

Model: gpt-4o-mini
Readability Score: 4/5
Score Reason: The chart presents the data clearly with well-defined bars and labels. The use of a consistent scale on the y-axis allows for easy comparison between different farms. However, the diagonal lines on the bars may slightly hinder readability, but overall, the information is still accessible and understandable.
