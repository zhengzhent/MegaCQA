Model: Qwen/Qwen2.5-VL-72B-Instruct
Readability Score: 4/5
Score Reason: The chart is straightforward and easy to interpret. The use of a single color gradient does not distract from the data. The labels for both the x-axis and y-axis are clear, and the values are directly placed on top of the bars, making it easy to understand the revenue for each company at a glance.

Model: gpt-4o-mini
Readability Score: 4/5
Score Reason: The visualization effectively presents the annual revenue data with clear labels and a straightforward bar chart format. The use of a gradient color scheme is visually appealing, but it may slightly detract from the clarity of the values displayed on the bars. However, the values are still legible, and the overall structure allows for easy comparison between the companies.
