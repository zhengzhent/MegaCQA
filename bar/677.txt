Model: Qwen/Qwen2.5-VL-72B-Instruct
Readability Score: 4/5
Score Reason: The chart is clear and well-organized, with each bar representing a different crop category. The use of a consistent pattern on the bars helps in maintaining uniformity, and the values are directly labeled on top of each bar, making it easy to read the exact production numbers. The title and axis labels are clear and provide context for the data being presented.

Model: gpt-4o-mini
Readability Score: 3/5
Score Reason: The chart presents the data in a clear bar format, but the use of diagonal lines in the bars makes it difficult to discern the exact values at a glance. Additionally, the labels for the crop categories are somewhat cluttered, which may hinder quick interpretation. However, the overall structure is logical and the axis labels are clear.
