Model: Qwen/Qwen2.5-VL-72B-Instruct
Readability Score: 4/5
Score Reason: The chart is clear and well-organized, with each bar representing a month's sales figures. The use of a gradient color scheme adds visual interest without detracting from the data. The values are directly labeled on top of each bar, making it easy to read the exact figures. The axis labels and title are clear and informative.

Model: gpt-4o-mini
Readability Score: 4/5
Score Reason: The visualization effectively presents monthly online sales figures with clear bar heights corresponding to the values. The labels for each month and the sales figures are legible, and the color gradient is visually appealing without being distracting. However, the color scheme could be improved for better contrast, especially for those with color vision deficiencies. Overall, the chart is easy to read and interpret.
