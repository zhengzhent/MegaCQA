--------------------------------------------------
Model: Qwen/Qwen2.5-VL-72B-Instruct
Readability Score: 4/5
Score Reason: The chart is clear and easy to interpret. Each bar is distinctly colored, and the values are labeled directly on the bars, making it easy to read the exact figures. The months are clearly marked on the x-axis, and the y-axis is labeled with a clear unit (thousand USD). The title provides context for the data being presented. The only potential issue is the non-chronological order of the months, which might cause a slight confusion, but it does not significantly impact the overall readability.

Model: gpt-4o-mini
Readability Score: 4/5
Score Reason: The chart presents monthly online sales figures clearly, with distinct colors for each month and well-placed labels. The y-axis is appropriately scaled, and the values are easy to read. However, the title could be more concise, and the color choice for April may be too bold compared to the others, which could distract from the overall readability. Overall, it is still quite easy to interpret.
