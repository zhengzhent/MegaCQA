--------------------------------------------------
Model: Qwen/Qwen2.5-VL-72B-Instruct
Readability Score: 4/5
Score Reason: The bar chart is well-structured with clear labels for each town and the number of visits. The use of a consistent pattern for the bars helps in distinguishing them from the background. The scale on the x-axis is appropriately spaced, and the values are legible. The title is descriptive and provides context for the data presented.

Model: gpt-4o-mini
Readability Score: 3/5
Score Reason: The visualization presents the data in a horizontal bar chart format, which is generally effective for comparing values across categories. However, the use of hatched patterns instead of solid colors makes it difficult to quickly discern the lengths of the bars, and the numbers are placed at the end of each bar, which can lead to misinterpretation. Additionally, the y-axis labels are not clearly aligned with the bars, which can confuse the viewer. Overall, while the data is present, the readability is compromised by the design choices.
