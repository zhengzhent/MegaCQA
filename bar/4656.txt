Model: Qwen/Qwen2.5-VL-72B-Instruct
Readability Score: 4/5
Score Reason: The chart is clear and well-organized, with distinct bars for each energy source. The use of a gradient color scheme adds visual interest without compromising clarity. The labels are legible, and the values are directly placed on top of each bar, making it easy to understand the data at a glance. The title and axis labels are also clear and informative.

Model: gpt-4o-mini
Readability Score: 4/5
Score Reason: The visualization effectively uses a bar chart to represent energy consumption data, with clear labels for each energy source and corresponding values. The color gradient from light to dark orange helps to differentiate the bars, and the overall layout is clean and organized. However, the use of a single color scheme may make it difficult for some viewers to distinguish between the bars at a glance, especially in a printed format. Overall, the chart is mostly readable and conveys the information well.
