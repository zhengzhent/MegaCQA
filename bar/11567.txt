Model: Qwen/Qwen2.5-VL-72B-Instruct
Readability Score: 4/5
Score Reason: The chart is straightforward and uses a clear bar graph format to represent the number of plays on different video sharing platforms. Each bar is labeled with the exact number of views, which makes it easy to compare the performance across platforms. The x-axis and y-axis are well-defined, and the title clearly states the purpose of the chart. However, the bars are not color-coded, which could have enhanced the visual distinction between platforms.

Model: gpt-4o-mini
Readability Score: 4/5
Score Reason: The chart effectively presents the number of plays across different platforms with clear labels and a straightforward bar format. The use of a consistent scale on the y-axis allows for easy comparison between platforms. However, the font size of the numbers on the bars could be larger for better visibility, and the title could be more concise. Overall, it is quite readable.
