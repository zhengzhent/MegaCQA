Model: Qwen/Qwen2.5-VL-72B-Instruct
Readability Score: 4/5
Score Reason: The bar chart is clear and well-organized, with each bar representing a town's hospital visits. The use of a gradient color scheme adds visual interest without detracting from the data. The labels for both the x-axis (town names) and y-axis (number of visits) are legible, and the exact number of visits is displayed on top of each bar, making it easy to interpret the data at a glance.

Model: gpt-4o-mini
Readability Score: 4/5
Score Reason: The visualization effectively uses a bar chart format to display hospital visit data across different towns. The color gradient is visually appealing, but it may distract from the data itself. The labels for each town and the corresponding visit numbers are clear and legible, allowing for easy comparison. However, the gradient could potentially make it harder to discern the exact values at a glance. Overall, the chart is mostly readable with minor distractions.
