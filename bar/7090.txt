Model: gpt-4o-mini
Readability Score: 4/5
Score Reason: The visualization effectively uses a bar chart to represent the number of employees across different companies. The colors are distinct, making it easy to differentiate between the companies. The labels are clear and legible, and the y-axis is appropriately scaled. However, the chart could benefit from a more consistent color scheme and a clearer title to enhance understanding. Overall, it is quite readable.
