Model: Qwen/Qwen2.5-VL-72B-Instruct
Readability Score: 4/5
Score Reason: The chart is clear and well-organized, with each city's student population easily distinguishable by the height of the bars. The use of a gradient color scheme adds visual interest without detracting from the data. The labels are legible, and the values are directly placed on top of the bars, making it straightforward to interpret the data at a glance.
