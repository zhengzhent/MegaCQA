--------------------------------------------------
Model: Qwen/Qwen2.5-VL-72B-Instruct
Readability Score: 4/5
Score Reason: The chart uses a gradient color scheme which adds visual interest but may not be necessary for data interpretation. The labels are clear and the values are directly displayed on the bars, which aids in understanding. However, the chart only shows four months, which might not give a complete picture of the yearly trend. The title is clear and the axis labels are appropriately named.

Model: gpt-4o-mini
Readability Score: 4/5
Score Reason: The visualization effectively uses a horizontal bar chart to display monthly online sales figures, making it easy to compare values across different months. The color gradient is visually appealing, but it may slightly distract from the numerical values. However, the labels are clear, and the scale is appropriately marked, allowing for straightforward interpretation of the data.
