Model: Qwen/Qwen2.5-VL-72B-Instruct
Readability Score: 4/5
Score Reason: The chart is clear and straightforward, with each bar representing the number of employees in different companies. The use of grid patterns within the bars adds a unique visual element but does not detract from readability. The labels are legible, and the numerical values are clearly marked on top of each bar, making it easy to compare the number of employees across companies.

Readability Score: 4/5
Score Reason: The visualization effectively presents the number of employees across different companies using a bar chart format. The bars are clearly labeled with the corresponding employee numbers, making it easy to compare the data. However, the grid lines and the overall design could be simplified to enhance clarity. Despite this, the essential information is conveyed well.
