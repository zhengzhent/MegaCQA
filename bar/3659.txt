Model: gpt-4o-mini
Readability Score: 4/5
Score Reason: The visualization effectively uses horizontal bars to compare the number of students across different cities, which is a clear and intuitive format. The labels are legible, and the numerical values are directly associated with their respective bars, making it easy to interpret the data. However, the grayscale color scheme may make it slightly challenging to differentiate between the bars, especially for those with color vision deficiencies. Overall, it remains quite readable.
