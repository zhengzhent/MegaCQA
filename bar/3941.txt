Model: Qwen/Qwen2.5-VL-72B-Instruct
Readability Score: 4/5
Score Reason: The chart is straightforward and uses a simple bar graph format, which is generally easy to interpret. The bars are clearly labeled with both the city names and the exact number of students, making it easy to compare the data at a glance. The use of diagonal lines for shading does not detract from the readability. However, the title could be more concise, and the y-axis label could be more clearly aligned with the axis for better clarity.

Model: gpt-4o-mini
Readability Score: 3/5
Score Reason: The chart presents the data in a clear bar format, but the use of diagonal lines for shading makes it difficult to quickly discern the height of the bars. Additionally, the labels for the cities are slightly tilted, which may hinder readability. The overall structure is good, but the visual elements detract from the ease of interpretation.
