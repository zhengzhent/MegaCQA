--------------------------------------------------
Model: Qwen/Qwen2.5-VL-72B-Instruct
Readability Score: 4/5
Score Reason: The visualization uses a gradient color scheme that adds visual interest but does not necessarily enhance readability. The bars are clearly labeled with their corresponding values, and the axis labels are legible. However, the months are not in chronological order, which can be slightly confusing for the viewer. Overall, the chart is relatively easy to read but could be improved with a chronological arrangement of months.

Model: gpt-4o-mini
Readability Score: 4/5
Score Reason: The visualization effectively uses a horizontal bar chart to display monthly sales figures, which allows for easy comparison between months. The color gradient is visually appealing, but it may slightly detract from clarity. However, the labels are clear, and the values are easily readable, making the overall interpretation straightforward.
