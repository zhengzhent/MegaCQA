Model: gpt-4o-mini
Readability Score: 4/5
Score Reason: The visualization effectively uses a horizontal bar chart format, which allows for easy comparison of hospital visits across different towns. The color gradient provides a visual cue for the magnitude of visits, and the labels are clear and legible. However, the chart could benefit from a more distinct separation between the bars to enhance readability further. Overall, it is quite easy to interpret the data presented.
