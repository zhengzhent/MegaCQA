--------------------------------------------------
Model: Qwen/Qwen2.5-VL-72B-Instruct
Readability Score: 4/5
Score Reason: The chart is clear and well-organized, with each bar representing a month's sales figures. The use of a consistent pattern on the bars helps in maintaining visual uniformity. The labels are legible, and the values are directly placed on top of the bars, making it easy to read the exact figures. However, the months are not in chronological order, which might cause a slight confusion for the reader when trying to understand the trend over time.

Model: gpt-4o-mini
Readability Score: 4/5
Score Reason: The chart presents the monthly online sales figures clearly, with distinct bars for each month. However, the use of diagonal hatching makes it slightly harder to discern the values at a glance compared to solid colors. The labels are legible, but the overall design could be simplified for better readability.
