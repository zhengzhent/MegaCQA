--------------------------------------------------
Model: Qwen/Qwen2.5-VL-72B-Instruct
Readability Score: 4/5
Score Reason: The chart uses a clear horizontal bar format, which is effective for comparing quantities across different categories. Each bar is distinctly colored, aiding in differentiation. The labels for both the companies and the number of employees are legible and placed appropriately. The scale on the x-axis is well-defined, making it easy to interpret the number of employees for each company. However, the title is somewhat redundant as it repeats the information already provided in the axis label.
