Model: Qwen/Qwen2.5-VL-72B-Instruct
Readability Score: 4/5
Score Reason: The chart is clear and well-organized, with each bar representing a month's sales figures. The use of a consistent pattern on the bars helps in distinguishing them from the background. The labels are legible, and the values are directly placed on top of each bar, making it easy to read the exact figures. However, the months are not in chronological order, which might cause a slight confusion for the reader.

Model: gpt-4o-mini
Readability Score: 4/5
Score Reason: The chart presents the monthly online sales figures clearly, with well-defined bars and appropriate labeling. However, the use of diagonal lines in the bars may distract some viewers, and the font size of the month labels could be larger for better visibility. Overall, the information is still interpretable without significant confusion.
