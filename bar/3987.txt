Model: Qwen/Qwen2.5-VL-72B-Instruct
Readability Score: 4/5
Score Reason: The chart is well-organized with clear labels and a straightforward layout. The use of a consistent pattern for the bars helps in distinguishing them from the background. The values are directly labeled on the bars, which makes it easy to read the exact numbers. The title and axis labels are clear and provide context for the data.

Model: gpt-4o-mini
Readability Score: 4/5
Score Reason: The visualization effectively uses a horizontal bar chart to compare the number of students across different cities. The labels are clear and the values are displayed at the end of each bar, making it easy to read. However, the use of a striped pattern on the bars may slightly detract from the clarity, but overall, the information is still easily interpretable.
