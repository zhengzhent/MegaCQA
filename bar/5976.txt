Readability Score: 4/5
Score Reason: The chart effectively uses distinct colors for each food category, making it easy to differentiate between them. The sales figures are clearly labeled on top of each bar, and the axis labels are straightforward. However, the title could be more descriptive, and the x-axis labels are slightly tilted, which may affect readability for some viewers. Overall, it is still quite easy to interpret the data.
