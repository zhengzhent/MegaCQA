Model: Qwen/Qwen2.5-VL-72B-Instruct
Readability Score: 4/5
Score Reason: The chart is clear and well-organized, with each city's student population easily distinguishable by the height of the bars. The use of diagonal lines within the bars adds a visual texture without cluttering the chart. The labels for both the x-axis (cities) and y-axis (thousand students) are legible, and the values are directly written on top of each bar, making it straightforward to interpret the data.

Model: gpt-4o-mini
Readability Score: 3/5
Score Reason: The chart presents the data in a clear bar format, but the use of diagonal lines within the bars makes it difficult to discern the exact values. Additionally, the labels for the cities are somewhat crowded, which may lead to confusion. However, the overall structure is understandable, and the y-axis is clearly labeled, allowing for a general comparison of student numbers across cities.
