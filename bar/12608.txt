Model: Qwen/Qwen2.5-VL-72B-Instruct
Readability Score: 4/5
Score Reason: The chart is clear and well-organized, with distinct colors for each bar that make it easy to differentiate between the movies. The values are directly labeled on top of each bar, which aids in quick comprehension. The title and axis labels are clear and provide context for the data being presented. However, the large difference in values, especially for 'Plain Sight', might make it a bit harder to compare the other movies' performances visually.
