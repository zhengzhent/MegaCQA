Model: gpt-4o-mini
Readability Score: 4/5
Score Reason: The visualization is clear and effectively uses color coding to differentiate between various energy sources. The horizontal bar chart format allows for easy comparison of energy consumption values, and the labels are legible. However, the chart could benefit from a more consistent color scheme and clearer labeling of the axes to enhance readability further.
