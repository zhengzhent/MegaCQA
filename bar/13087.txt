Model: gpt-4o-mini
Readability Score: 4/5
Score Reason: The visualization effectively uses a bar chart format to display the number of visitors to various attractions. The bars are clearly labeled with both the attraction names and the corresponding visitor numbers, making it easy to interpret the data. The color gradient adds visual appeal without compromising clarity. However, the font size of the attraction names could be slightly larger for improved readability.
