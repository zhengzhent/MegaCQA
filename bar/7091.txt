Model: Qwen/Qwen2.5-VL-72B-Instruct
Readability Score: 4/5
Score Reason: The chart is well-organized with clear labels and a straightforward layout. The use of a consistent pattern for the bars helps in maintaining uniformity, and the numerical values are directly placed at the end of each bar, making it easy to read the exact number of employees for each company. The spacing between the bars is adequate, preventing any confusion.

Model: gpt-4o-mini
Readability Score: 3/5
Score Reason: The visualization uses a horizontal bar chart format, which is generally effective for comparing quantities. However, the use of hatch patterns instead of solid colors makes it difficult to quickly discern the lengths of the bars, leading to potential confusion. Additionally, the labels are somewhat cluttered, and the overall design lacks clarity, which detracts from readability.
