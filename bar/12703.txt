Model: Qwen/Qwen2.5-VL-72B-Instruct
Readability Score: 4/5
Score Reason: The chart is clear and well-organized, with each bar representing a different movie's box office earnings. The use of consistent patterns on the bars helps in distinguishing them from one another. The labels for both the x-axis (movie titles) and y-axis (box office earnings in million USD) are legible and straightforward. The values are also clearly marked on top of each bar, making it easy to interpret the data at a glance.

Model: gpt-4o-mini
Readability Score: 4/5
Score Reason: The chart presents the box office earnings of different movies clearly, with distinct bars and labeled values. However, the use of diagonal lines in the bars may slightly hinder readability, and the x-axis labels are somewhat cramped, making it a bit challenging to read the movie titles. Overall, the information is still interpretable without much effort.
