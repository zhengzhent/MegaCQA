Model: gpt-4o-mini
Readability Score: 4/5
Score Reason: The visualization effectively uses distinct colors for each energy source, making it easy to differentiate between them. The bar heights are proportional to the values, and the labels are clearly visible. However, the x-axis label 'Energy' is slightly tilted, which may cause minor readability issues. Overall, the chart conveys the information clearly and can be interpreted quickly.
