--------------------------------------------------
Model: Qwen/Qwen2.5-VL-72B-Instruct
Readability Score: 4/5
Score Reason: The chart is clear and well-organized, with each bar representing a different farm's fruit transportation flow in tons. The use of a consistent pattern on the bars helps in maintaining uniformity, and the values are directly labeled on top of each bar, making it easy to read the exact figures. The x-axis and y-axis are clearly labeled, and the title provides a clear context for the data being presented.

Model: gpt-4o-mini
Readability Score: 3/5
Score Reason: The chart presents the data in a clear bar format, but the use of diagonal lines for shading makes it difficult to discern the exact values of each bar. Additionally, the labels for the farms are somewhat cramped, which may lead to confusion. Overall, while the general trend can be understood, the readability is hindered by the design choices.
