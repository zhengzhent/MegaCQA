Model: gpt-4o-mini
Readability Score: 4/5
Score Reason: The chart effectively presents the number of artworks created across different cities with clear labels and a straightforward bar format. However, the use of diagonal hatching on the bars may reduce clarity, making it slightly harder to discern the exact values at a glance. Overall, the information is still interpretable, but the hatching could be simplified for better readability.
