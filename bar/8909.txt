Model: gpt-4o-mini
Readability Score: 4/5
Score Reason: The visualization effectively uses horizontal bars to represent different house types and their corresponding sale prices, making it easy to compare values at a glance. The color coding is distinct and helps differentiate between the categories. However, the numerical values are placed at the end of the bars, which may require additional effort to read. Overall, the chart is clear and understandable.
