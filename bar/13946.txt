Model: Qwen/Qwen2.5-VL-72B-Instruct
Readability Score: 4/5
Score Reason: The chart is clear and well-organized, with each bar distinctly labeled with the number of visitors. The use of stars as a fill pattern is visually interesting and does not detract from the readability. The labels for both the x-axis and y-axis are clear, and the title provides a good context for the data. The values are directly placed on top of the bars, making it easy to read the exact number of visitors for each attraction.

Model: gpt-4o-mini
Readability Score: 2/5
Score Reason: The visualization uses a star pattern to represent data, which can be visually appealing but makes it difficult to accurately gauge the number of visitors. The bars are not filled in a conventional manner, and the numbers on top can be hard to read due to the background pattern. Additionally, the x-axis labels are angled, which may hinder readability. Overall, the chart lacks clarity and precision.
