Model: Qwen/Qwen2.5-VL-72B-Instruct
Readability Score: 4/5
Score Reason: The chart is clear and well-organized, with distinct colors for each bar that make it easy to differentiate between towns. The labels for both the x-axis and y-axis are legible, and the values are directly written on top of each bar, which aids in quick interpretation. However, the use of the same value (800000) for multiple towns might be misleading as it suggests a cap or an error in data representation.

Model: gpt-4o-mini
Readability Score: 4/5
Score Reason: The visualization effectively uses a bar chart to represent hospital visits across different towns. The colors are distinct, making it easy to differentiate between the towns. The numerical values on top of each bar provide clear information about the number of visits, and the axis labels are legible. However, the chart could benefit from a more consistent color scheme and a clearer title to enhance understanding. Overall, it is quite readable.
