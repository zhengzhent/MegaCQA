Model: Qwen/Qwen2.5-VL-72B-Instruct
Readability Score: 4/5
Score Reason: The chart is clear and well-organized, with each energy source distinctly labeled on the x-axis and corresponding TWh values on the y-axis. The use of consistent bar patterns and direct labeling of values on top of each bar enhances readability. The title clearly states the context of the data, making it easy for the viewer to understand the purpose of the visualization.

Model: gpt-4o-mini
Readability Score: 4/5
Score Reason: The chart presents the data clearly with distinct bars for each energy source, and the values are labeled directly on the bars, making it easy to read. However, the use of diagonal lines on the bars may slightly detract from clarity, but overall, the information is still easily interpretable.
