--------------------------------------------------
Model: Qwen/Qwen2.5-VL-72B-Instruct
Readability Score: 4/5
Score Reason: The chart uses distinct colors for each bar, which helps in distinguishing the data for different months. The values are clearly labeled on top of each bar, making it easy to read the exact figures. However, the months are not in chronological order, which might confuse the reader when trying to understand the trend over time. The title and axis labels are clear and informative.

Readability Score: 4/5
Score Reason: The chart effectively presents monthly online sales figures with clear labels for each month and corresponding sales values. The use of distinct colors for each bar enhances visual differentiation, and the y-axis is appropriately scaled. However, the color choices could be improved for better contrast, and the title could be more concise. Overall, the information is accessible and can be interpreted without much effort.
