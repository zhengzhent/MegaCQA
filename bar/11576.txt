--------------------------------------------------
Model: Qwen/Qwen2.5-VL-72B-Instruct
Readability Score: 4/5
Score Reason: The chart is clear and well-organized, with each platform's data represented by a distinct bar. The use of stars as a pattern inside the bars adds visual interest without cluttering the information. The labels for both the x-axis and y-axis are legible, and the values are clearly marked on top of each bar, making it easy to understand the number of views for each platform. The title is descriptive and provides context for the data.

Model: gpt-4o-mini
Readability Score: 3/5
Score Reason: The chart effectively displays the number of plays across different platforms, but the use of star patterns within the bars can be distracting and may obscure the actual values. Additionally, the y-axis scale is not clearly marked, which could lead to misinterpretation of the data. Overall, while the information is present, the visual design detracts from clarity.
