Model: Qwen/Qwen2.5-VL-72B-Instruct
Readability Score: 4/5
Score Reason: The chart is straightforward and easy to interpret. The bars are clearly labeled with both the crop category and the corresponding production values in metric tons. The use of a consistent pattern for all bars maintains uniformity, and the spacing between bars is adequate, preventing any visual clutter. The title and axis labels are clear and informative, enhancing the overall readability.

Model: gpt-4o-mini
Readability Score: 4/5
Score Reason: The chart presents the data clearly with distinct bars for each crop category. However, the use of diagonal hatching makes it slightly harder to differentiate between the bars, especially in a black and white format. The labels are legible, but the y-axis could benefit from clearer numerical intervals. Overall, it is fairly easy to read but has some minor issues that affect clarity.
