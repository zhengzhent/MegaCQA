Model: gpt-4o-mini
Readability Score: 4/5
Score Reason: The visualization effectively uses a bar chart to represent house sales data, with clear labels for each property type and corresponding values displayed on the bars. The color gradient is visually appealing and does not detract from the readability. However, the font size of the labels could be slightly larger for improved legibility, especially for viewers at a distance. Overall, the chart is easy to interpret and understand.
