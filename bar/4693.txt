Model: gpt-4o-mini
Readability Score: 4/5
Score Reason: The visualization effectively uses a horizontal bar chart to display energy consumption data, with clear labels for each energy type and corresponding values. The gradient color scheme is visually appealing and helps differentiate between the categories. However, the lack of distinct color contrast between the bars may make it slightly harder for some viewers to quickly identify differences in consumption levels. Overall, the chart is mostly clear and easy to interpret.
