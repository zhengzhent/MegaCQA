Model: Qwen/Qwen2.5-VL-72B-Instruct
Readability Score: 4/5
Score Reason: The chart is straightforward and easy to interpret. The bars are clearly labeled with their respective values, and the use of a gradient color does not detract from the readability. The axis labels and title are clear and appropriately placed, making it easy to understand the data at a glance.

Model: gpt-4o-mini
Readability Score: 4/5
Score Reason: The visualization effectively communicates the number of artworks created across different cities. The bar for Ironwood is significantly taller than the others, clearly indicating its dominance. However, the gradient color scheme may make it slightly difficult to discern the exact values at a glance, and the labels could be more prominent. Overall, it is fairly easy to read but could benefit from minor adjustments.
