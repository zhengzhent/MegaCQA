Model: Qwen/Qwen2.5-VL-72B-Instruct
Readability Score: 4/5
Score Reason: The chart is clear and well-organized, with distinct bars for each platform and clear labeling of the number of views. The use of a gradient color scheme adds visual interest without detracting from the data. The title and axis labels are straightforward and informative, making it easy to understand the data at a glance.

Model: gpt-4o-mini
Readability Score: 4/5
Score Reason: The visualization effectively uses a bar chart to compare the number of plays across different platforms. The labels are clear, and the color gradient helps to differentiate the bars. However, the y-axis could benefit from clearer labeling, as the scale is not immediately obvious, which may cause some confusion. Overall, it is relatively easy to interpret.
