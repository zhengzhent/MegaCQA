Model: Qwen/Qwen2.5-VL-72B-Instruct
Readability Score: 4/5
Score Reason: The chart is clear and well-organized, with each property type distinctly labeled along the x-axis and corresponding sales data in thousand USD on the y-axis. The use of grid patterns within the bars adds a unique visual element but does not detract from readability. The values are directly placed on top of each bar, making it easy to read the exact figures. The title is descriptive and provides context for the data presented.

Model: gpt-4o-mini
Readability Score: 4/5
Score Reason: The visualization effectively uses a bar chart to represent house sales data, with clear labels for property types and corresponding values. However, the grid lines and the font size of the numbers on the bars may make it slightly cluttered, which could hinder quick interpretation. Overall, it is still relatively easy to read and understand the data presented.
