Model: Qwen/Qwen2.5-VL-72B-Instruct
Readability Score: 4/5
Score Reason: The chart is clear and well-organized, with each bar representing a different farm's fruit transportation flow in tons. The use of stars as a pattern within the bars adds a visual element without cluttering the information. The labels for both the x-axis (farms) and y-axis (tons) are legible, and the numerical values are clearly marked on top of each bar, making it easy to compare the amounts at a glance.

Model: gpt-4o-mini
Readability Score: 2/5
Score Reason: The visualization uses a star pattern for the bars, which can be visually distracting and makes it difficult to accurately gauge the height of each bar. Additionally, the values are placed on the bars, but the star pattern complicates quick reading. The overall layout is clear, but the choice of design detracts from the readability.
