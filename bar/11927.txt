Model: Qwen/Qwen2.5-VL-72B-Instruct
Readability Score: 5/5
Score Reason: The chart is straightforward and easy to interpret. Each bar is clearly labeled with the platform name and the corresponding number of views. The use of distinct colors for each platform helps in distinguishing them easily. The title and axis labels are clear and provide necessary context. The values are directly written on top of each bar, which makes it easy to read the exact numbers without needing to refer to the y-axis.
