--------------------------------------------------
Model: Qwen/Qwen2.5-VL-72B-Instruct
Readability Score: 4/5
Score Reason: The chart is clear and well-organized, with each energy source distinctly labeled on the x-axis and the corresponding energy consumption values on the y-axis. The use of consistent bar patterns and direct labeling of values on top of each bar enhances readability. The title and axis labels are clear and informative, making it easy to understand the data at a glance.

Model: gpt-4o-mini
Readability Score: 4/5
Score Reason: The chart presents energy consumption data clearly with distinct bars for each energy type. The use of a consistent scale on the y-axis allows for easy comparison between categories. However, the diagonal lines in the bars may slightly hinder readability, and the font size of the labels could be larger for better visibility. Overall, it is still quite easy to interpret the data.
