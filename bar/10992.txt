Readability Score: 4/5
Score Reason: The chart is clear and well-organized, with each city's R&D investment easily identifiable.

Model: gpt-4o-mini
Readability Score: 4/5
Score Reason: The chart presents the data clearly with well-defined bars and labels for each city. However, the use of hatched patterns instead of solid colors may make it slightly harder to distinguish between the bars, especially in a printed format. The y-axis is clearly labeled, and the values are easy to read, contributing positively to the overall readability.
