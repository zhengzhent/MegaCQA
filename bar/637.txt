Model: Qwen/Qwen2.5-VL-72B-Instruct
Readability Score: 4/5
Score Reason: The chart is straightforward and uses a clear bar graph format. Each bar is labeled with its corresponding value, making it easy to understand the production quantities of different crops. The axis labels are legible, and the title provides a clear context for the data. The use of a single color for all bars keeps the chart simple and uncluttered.

Model: gpt-4o-mini
Readability Score: 4/5
Score Reason: The chart effectively presents the production of different crops with clear labels and a straightforward bar format. The use of a consistent scale on the y-axis allows for easy comparison between the crop categories. However, the lack of color differentiation and the somewhat cramped layout could make it slightly less engaging. Overall, it remains quite readable.
