Model: Qwen/Qwen2.5-VL-72B-Instruct
Readability Score: 4/5
Score Reason: The chart is straightforward with clear labels and a simple bar design. The use of diagonal lines for shading adds a visual element without cluttering the chart. The values are directly placed on top of each bar, making it easy to read the exact numbers. The title and axis labels are clear and informative.

Model: gpt-4o-mini
Readability Score: 3/5
Score Reason: The chart presents the data in a clear bar format, but the use of diagonal lines for shading makes it harder to distinguish between the bars. Additionally, the numbers on the bars are somewhat small and may be difficult to read, especially for viewers with visual impairments. The overall layout is straightforward, but the shading and font size detract from its readability.
