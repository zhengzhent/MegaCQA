Model: gpt-4o-mini
Readability Score: 4/5
Score Reason: The visualization effectively uses a horizontal bar chart to display sales figures, making it easy to compare different food categories. The labels are clear, and the values are directly associated with their respective bars. However, the use of diagonal lines within the bars may slightly detract from readability, as it can make it harder to quickly gauge the length of each bar. Overall, the chart is still quite readable.
