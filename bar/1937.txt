Model: Qwen/Qwen2.5-VL-72B-Instruct
Readability Score: 5/5
Score Reason: The chart is well-organized with clear labels for both the x-axis and y-axis. The use of a gradient color scheme adds visual interest without detracting from the data. The values are directly labeled on top of each bar, making it easy to read the exact revenue figures. The spacing between bars is adequate, preventing any overlap or clutter.

Model: gpt-4o-mini
Readability Score: 4/5
Score Reason: The visualization effectively uses a bar chart format to display the annual revenue data of various companies. The bars are clearly labeled with both company names and revenue figures, making it easy to compare values. The color gradient is visually appealing and does not detract from readability. However, the use of a single color gradient may make it slightly harder to distinguish between the bars at a glance compared to using contrasting colors. Overall, the chart is well-structured and conveys the information clearly.
