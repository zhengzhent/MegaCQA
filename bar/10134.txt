Model: Qwen/Qwen2.5-VL-72B-Instruct
Readability Score: 4/5
Score Reason: The chart is well-organized with clear labels and distinct colors for each city, making it easy to differentiate between them. The values are directly displayed on the bars, which enhances readability. However, the similarity in bar lengths for most cities (except Yorkton and Ironwood) might make it slightly less intuitive to compare the investments at a glance.

Model: gpt-4o-mini
Readability Score: 4/5
Score Reason: The visualization effectively uses horizontal bars to represent R&D investments across different cities, making it easy to compare values. The colors are distinct and help differentiate the cities, while the labels are clear and legible. However, the scale of the y-axis could be improved for better clarity, as the significant difference in investment for Yorkton compared to others may not be immediately apparent. Overall, it is quite readable.
