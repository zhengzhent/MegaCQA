Model: gpt-4o-mini
Readability Score: 4/5
Score Reason: The chart effectively presents the number of plays across different platforms with clear labels and a straightforward bar format. The use of distinct colors for each platform enhances readability, and the values are clearly displayed on top of the bars. However, the slight tilt of the 'LINE TV' and 'Facebook' labels may cause minor readability issues. Overall, the visualization is easy to interpret.
