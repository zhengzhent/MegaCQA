Model: Qwen/Qwen2.5-VL-72B-Instruct
Readability Score: 4/5
Score Reason: The chart is well-organized with clear labels and a straightforward layout. The use of horizontal bars makes it easy to compare the box office earnings of different movies. The values are directly written at the end of each bar, which aids in quick comprehension. However, the bars are quite similar in length, which might make precise comparisons a bit challenging.

Readability Score: 4/5
Score Reason: The visualization effectively uses horizontal bars to represent the box office earnings of different movies, making it easy to compare values at a glance. The labels are clear, and the scale is straightforward. However, the use of a grid pattern within the bars may slightly distract from the overall readability, but it does not significantly hinder understanding.
