Model: Qwen/Qwen2.5-VL-72B-Instruct
Readability Score: 4/5
Score Reason: The chart is clear and easy to interpret. Each bar is distinctly colored, and the values are directly labeled on top of each bar, making it straightforward to understand the sales figures for each month. The months are abbreviated but still easily recognizable, and the y-axis is clearly labeled with the unit of measurement. The only potential issue is the non-chronological order of the months, which might cause a slight confusion about the time sequence.
