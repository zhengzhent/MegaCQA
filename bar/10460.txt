Readability Score: 4/5
Score Reason: The visualization effectively uses a bar chart format to display R&D investment across cities, with clear labels for both the cities and the investment amounts. The gradient color scheme enhances visual appeal without compromising readability. However, the use of decimal points in the investment figures may slightly complicate quick comparisons for some viewers. Overall, the chart is well-structured and easy to interpret.
