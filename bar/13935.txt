Model: Qwen/Qwen2.5-VL-72B-Instruct
Readability Score: 4/5
Score Reason: The chart is well-organized with clear labels for each attraction and the number of visitors. The use of stars as a pattern in the bars adds visual interest without cluttering the information. The values are directly placed on top of the bars, making it easy to read the exact number of visitors for each attraction. The title and axis labels are clear and informative.

Model: gpt-4o-mini
Readability Score: 3/5
Score Reason: The visualization uses a bar chart format, which is generally effective for comparing values. However, the use of star patterns within the bars makes it difficult to accurately gauge the heights of the bars, as the patterns can distract from the actual values. Additionally, the numbers on top of the bars are somewhat small and may be hard to read, especially for viewers with visual impairments. Overall, while the chart conveys the necessary information, the design choices hinder its readability.
