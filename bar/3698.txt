Model: gpt-4o-mini
Readability Score: 4/5
Score Reason: The visualization effectively uses horizontal bars to compare the number of students across different cities, which is easy to interpret. The color gradient helps to visually distinguish the data, and the labels are clear and legible. However, the lack of a clear numerical scale on the y-axis may cause slight confusion. Overall, it is quite readable.
