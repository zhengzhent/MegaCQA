Model: Qwen/Qwen2.5-VL-72B-Instruct
Readability Score: 4/5
Score Reason: The chart is straightforward and uses a clear horizontal bar format to represent the number of hospital visits in different towns. The labels for towns and the number of visits are legible and placed appropriately. The use of diagonal lines for shading adds a visual distinction without cluttering the chart. The scale on the x-axis is evenly spaced and easy to follow, making it simple to compare the number of visits across towns.

Model: gpt-4o-mini
Readability Score: 3/5
Score Reason: The visualization presents the data in a clear bar chart format, but the use of hatched patterns instead of solid colors makes it difficult to quickly discern the values. Additionally, the y-axis labels are somewhat cluttered, and the numbers are not aligned with the bars, which can lead to misinterpretation. Overall, while the information is present, the readability is compromised.
