Readability Score: 4/5
Score Reason: The chart is clear and well-organized, with each food category distinctly labeled and the sales figures easily readable. The use of a consistent pattern for the bars helps in maintaining uniformity, and the values are directly placed on top of the bars, which aids in quick comprehension. The title and axis labels are clear and informative.

Model: gpt-4o-mini
Readability Score: 4/5
Score Reason: The visualization effectively presents the sales figures for different food categories with clear labeling and a straightforward bar chart format. However, the use of diagonal lines in the bars may slightly hinder readability, and the y-axis scale could be more intuitive. Overall, it is still relatively easy to interpret the data.
