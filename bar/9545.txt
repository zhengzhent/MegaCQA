--------------------------------------------------
Model: Qwen/Qwen2.5-VL-72B-Instruct
Readability Score: 4/5
Score Reason: The chart is clear and easy to interpret. Each bar is distinctly colored, and the values are labeled directly on the bars, making it straightforward to understand the sales figures for each month. The months are clearly marked on the x-axis, and the y-axis is labeled with a clear unit (thousand USD). The only potential issue is the non-chronological order of the months, which might cause a slight confusion, but it does not significantly impact the overall readability.

Model: gpt-4o-mini
Readability Score: 4/5
Score Reason: The chart effectively presents monthly online sales figures with clear labels and a straightforward bar format. The use of distinct colors for each month aids in differentiation, and the values displayed on top of the bars enhance clarity. However, the y-axis could benefit from more detailed labeling to improve understanding of the scale. Overall, it is easy to read and interpret.
