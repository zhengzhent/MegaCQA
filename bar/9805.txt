Model: Qwen/Qwen2.5-VL-72B-Instruct
Readability Score: 4/5
Score Reason: The chart is clear and easy to interpret. Each bar is distinctly colored, and the values are labeled directly on the bars, making it straightforward to understand the sales figures for each month. The months are clearly marked on the x-axis, and the y-axis is labeled with the unit of measurement, which is helpful for context. However, the months are not in chronological order, which might cause a slight confusion for the reader.
