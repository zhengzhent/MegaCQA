Model: Qwen/Qwen2.5-VL-72B-Instruct
Readability Score: 4/5
Score Reason: The chart is clear and well-organized, with each company's revenue data presented in a bar format. The use of a consistent pattern for all bars maintains uniformity, and the labels are legible. The values are directly placed on top of each bar, making it easy to read the exact revenue figures. The title and axis labels are clear and informative.

Model: gpt-4o-mini
Readability Score: 4/5
Score Reason: The chart presents the annual revenue data clearly with distinct bars for each company. However, the use of diagonal hatching on the bars may make it slightly harder to read the values at a glance. The labels are clear, and the y-axis is appropriately scaled, but the values on top of the bars could be more prominent for better visibility.
