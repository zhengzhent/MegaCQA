Model: Qwen/Qwen2.5-VL-72B-Instruct
Readability Score: 4/5
Score Reason: The chart uses a gradient color scheme which adds an aesthetic appeal but does not necessarily enhance readability. The labels for the towns and the number of visits are clearly visible, and the scale is easy to follow. However, the gradient might be misleading as it doesn't provide additional information about the data. Overall, the chart is quite readable but could be improved by using a more straightforward color scheme.

Model: gpt-4o-mini
Readability Score: 4/5
Score Reason: The visualization effectively uses horizontal bars to represent the data, making it easy to compare the number of hospital visits across different towns. The color gradient is visually appealing, but the lack of clear numerical labels on the bars may cause some confusion. However, the overall layout is straightforward and the titles are clear.
