Model: Qwen/Qwen2.5-VL-72B-Instruct
Readability Score: 5/5
Score Reason: The chart is clear and well-organized, with distinct colors for each bar that make it easy to differentiate between towns. The labels for both the x-axis and y-axis are legible, and the numerical values are displayed on top of each bar, which aids in quickly understanding the data. The title is descriptive and provides context for the data presented.

Model: gpt-4o-mini
Readability Score: 4/5
Score Reason: The visualization is clear and effectively presents the data on hospital visits across different towns. The use of distinct colors for each bar helps in differentiating the towns, and the labels are legible. The y-axis is appropriately scaled, making it easy to compare the number of visits. However, the bars for Fairview and Springvale are the same height, which could lead to confusion without additional context. Overall, it is mostly easy to read.
