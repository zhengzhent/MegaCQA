Model: Qwen/Qwen2.5-VL-72B-Instruct
Readability Score: 5/5
Score Reason: The chart is well-organized with a clear title and axis labels. The use of a gradient color scheme helps in visually distinguishing the number of visits, with darker shades indicating higher values. The data values are directly labeled on the bars, making it easy to read the exact number of visits for each town. The spacing between the bars is adequate, and there is no clutter, which enhances readability.

Model: gpt-4o-mini
Readability Score: 4/5
Score Reason: The visualization effectively uses a horizontal bar chart format, which is suitable for comparing the number of hospital visits across different towns. The color gradient helps to visually differentiate the data, and the labels are clear and easy to read. However, the chart could benefit from a more distinct separation between the bars and a clearer numerical scale for better precision in reading the values.
