Model: Qwen/Qwen2.5-VL-72B-Instruct
Readability Score: 4/5
Score Reason: The chart is straightforward and uses a clear bar graph format. The labels for both the x-axis and y-axis are legible and appropriately placed. The values are directly written on top of each bar, which makes it easy to read the exact number of visitors for each attraction. The use of a consistent pattern for all bars maintains uniformity, and the spacing between bars is adequate, preventing any visual clutter.

Model: gpt-4o-mini
Readability Score: 4/5
Score Reason: The chart effectively presents the data with clear labels for each attraction and a straightforward y-axis indicating the number of visitors. However, the use of diagonal hatching on the bars may reduce clarity, and the decimal numbers could be confusing for some readers. Overall, it is relatively easy to interpret but could be improved for better readability.
