Model: Qwen/Qwen2.5-VL-72B-Instruct
Readability Score: 4/5
Score Reason: The chart is well-organized with clear labels and distinct colors for each bar, making it easy to differentiate between months. The values are directly written on top of each bar, which aids in quick data interpretation. However, the months are not in chronological order, which might cause a slight confusion for the reader.

Model: gpt-4o-mini
Readability Score: 4/5
Score Reason: The chart presents the monthly online sales figures clearly, with distinct colors for each month and readable labels. However, the large discrepancy in the height of the bars, particularly the significant spike in October, may distract from the overall trends. The y-axis is appropriately labeled, but the scale could be more evenly distributed to enhance comparison across months.
