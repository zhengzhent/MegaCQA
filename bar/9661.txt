Model: Qwen/Qwen2.5-VL-72B-Instruct
Readability Score: 4/5
Score Reason: The chart is well-organized with clear labels and distinct colors for each bar, making it easy to differentiate between months. The values are directly written on top of each bar, which aids in quick data interpretation. However, the months are not in chronological order, which might cause a slight confusion for the reader.

Model: gpt-4o-mini
Readability Score: 4/5
Score Reason: The visualization effectively presents monthly online sales figures with clear labeling of both the months and the corresponding sales values. The use of distinct colors for each bar enhances differentiation, and the scale on the y-axis is appropriate for the data range. However, the height of the August bar significantly overshadows the others, which may distract from the overall trends. Despite this, the chart remains readable and conveys the necessary information clearly.
