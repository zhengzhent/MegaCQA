Model: Qwen/Qwen2.5-VL-72B-Instruct
Readability Score: 4/5
Score Reason: The chart uses distinct colors for each bar, which helps in distinguishing the data for different months. However, the months are not in chronological order, which can be confusing. The values are clearly labeled on top of each bar, and the scale is easy to understand. The title is clear and provides context for the data.

Model: gpt-4o-mini
Readability Score: 4/5
Score Reason: The chart effectively presents monthly online sales figures with clear labeling of months and corresponding values. The use of distinct colors for each bar enhances visual differentiation, and the values are prominently displayed on top of the bars, making it easy to interpret the data at a glance. However, the y-axis could benefit from clearer labeling to avoid confusion regarding the scale, but overall, it remains quite readable.
