Model: Qwen/Qwen2.5-VL-72B-Instruct
Readability Score: 4/5
Score Reason: The chart is clear and straightforward, with distinct colors for each city's bar, making it easy to differentiate between them. The values are directly labeled on top of each bar, which aids in quick comprehension. The title and axis labels are clear and provide necessary context. The only potential issue is the uniformity of the values for four out of five cities, which might make the chart less informative for comparative analysis, but this does not affect readability.
