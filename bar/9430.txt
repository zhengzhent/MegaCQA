Model: Qwen/Qwen2.5-VL-72B-Instruct
Readability Score: 4/5
Score Reason: The chart uses a clear bar graph format with distinct colors for each month, which helps in differentiating the data points. The values are directly labeled on top of each bar, making it easy to read the exact figures. However, the months are not in chronological order, which might cause some confusion for the viewer. Overall, the chart is quite readable but could be improved with a logical sequence of months.
