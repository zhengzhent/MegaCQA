The bars are evenly spaced, and the values are directly labeled on top of each bar, making it easy to compare the amounts. The axis labels are clear, and the title provides a good context for the data. There is no clutter, and the information is presented in a straightforward manner.

Model: gpt-4o-mini
Readability Score: 4/5
Score Reason: The chart presents the data clearly with well-defined bars and appropriate labeling. The use of a consistent scale on the y-axis allows for easy comparison between different farms. However, the rotation of the x-axis labels makes them slightly harder to read, which could affect quick interpretation. Overall, the visualization is mostly clear and understandable.
