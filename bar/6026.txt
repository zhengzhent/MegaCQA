Model: Qwen/Qwen2.5-VL-72B-Instruct
Readability Score: 4/5
Score Reason: The chart uses a horizontal bar format which is effective for comparing values across different categories. Each bar is clearly labeled with the town name and the number of visits, and the use of distinct colors for each bar helps in distinguishing them. The scale on the x-axis is appropriate for the range of data, and the title clearly states the purpose of the chart. However, the color choice for some bars is quite similar, which might make it slightly challenging to differentiate at a glance.
