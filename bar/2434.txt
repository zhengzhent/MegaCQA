Model: gpt-4o-mini
Readability Score: 4/5
Score Reason: The visualization effectively uses a horizontal bar chart to display the number of artworks created across different cities. The labels for both the cities and the numbers are clear and legible. However, the use of diagonal hatching within the bars may slightly detract from the overall clarity, making it harder to quickly assess the values at a glance. Despite this, the chart remains relatively easy to interpret.
