Model: gpt-4o-mini
Readability Score: 4/5
Score Reason: The visualization effectively uses horizontal bars to represent the number of visitors to each attraction, making it easy to compare values at a glance. The labels are clear and the scale is appropriately marked, allowing for straightforward interpretation of the data. However, the use of hatched patterns instead of solid colors may slightly reduce clarity, but overall, it remains quite readable.
