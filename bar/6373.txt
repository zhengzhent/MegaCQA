Model: Qwen/Qwen2.5-VL-72B-Instruct
Readability Score: 4/5
Score Reason: The chart is clear and well-organized, with each bar representing a town's hospital visits. The use of stars as a pattern in the bars adds a visual element but does not detract from the readability. The labels for both the x-axis (town names) and y-axis (number of visits) are legible, and the numerical values are displayed on top of each bar, making it easy to understand the exact number of visits for each town. The title is descriptive and provides context for the data.

Model: gpt-4o-mini
Readability Score: 3/5
Score Reason: The visualization uses a bar chart format, which is generally effective for comparing quantities. However, the use of star patterns within the bars makes it difficult to accurately gauge the height of each bar, leading to potential misinterpretation of the data. Additionally, the font size of the town names is relatively small, which may hinder readability. Overall, while the data is presented in a structured manner, the decorative elements detract from clarity.
