Model: Qwen/Qwen2.5-VL-72B-Instruct
Readability Score: 4/5
Score Reason: The chart is visually appealing with distinct colors for each bar, which helps in distinguishing the data for each month. However, the months are not in chronological order, which can be confusing for the reader. The values are clearly labeled on top of each bar, and the title and axes are well-defined, making it easy to understand the data at a glance.

Readability Score: 4/5
Score Reason: The chart presents monthly online sales figures clearly, with distinct colors for each month and well-defined bars. The axis labels are legible, and the values are easy to read. However, the color choices could be improved for better contrast, and the chart could benefit from a more consistent color scheme. Overall, it is still quite readable.
