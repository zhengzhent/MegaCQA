Model: Qwen/Qwen2.5-VL-72B-Instruct
Readability Score: 4/5
Score Reason: The chart is relatively simple with clear labels and values for each bar. The gradient color scheme adds a visual element but does not detract from the readability. However, the months are not in chronological order, which can be slightly confusing for the viewer. The title and axis labels are clear and informative.

Model: gpt-4o-mini
Readability Score: 4/5
Score Reason: The chart effectively presents the monthly online sales figures with clear labels for each month and corresponding sales values. However, the use of a monochromatic color scheme may make it difficult for some viewers to distinguish between the bars, especially in a printed format. The values are clearly displayed, but the overall visual impact could be improved with more contrasting colors.
