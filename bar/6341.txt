--------------------------------------------------
Model: Qwen/Qwen2.5-VL-72B-Instruct
Readability Score: 4/5
Score Reason: The chart is clear and straightforward, with each bar representing a town's hospital visits. The labels are legible, and the values are directly placed on top of each bar, making it easy to compare the number of visits across different towns. The use of a grid helps in estimating the values even without the exact numbers. However, the scale on the y-axis is quite large, which might make it a bit challenging to grasp the differences between towns with similar visit numbers.

Model: gpt-4o-mini
Readability Score: 4/5
Score Reason: The visualization effectively uses a bar chart format to display hospital visit data across different towns. The bars are clearly labeled with the number of visits, and the y-axis is appropriately scaled. However, the font size of the town names is somewhat small, which may make it difficult for some viewers to read. Overall, the chart is mostly clear and conveys the information well.
