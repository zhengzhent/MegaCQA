Model: Qwen/Qwen2.5-VL-72B-Instruct
Readability Score: 5/5
Score Reason: The bar chart is clear and well-organized, with each bar representing a town's hospital visits. The use of a gradient color scheme from light to dark red helps in visually distinguishing the number of visits, with darker colors indicating higher visits. The labels for both the x-axis (town names) and y-axis (number of visits) are legible, and the exact number of visits is displayed on top of each bar, making it easy to interpret the data at a glance.
