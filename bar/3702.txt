Model: Qwen/Qwen2.5-VL-72B-Instruct
Readability Score: 4/5
Score Reason: The chart is well-organized with clear labels and a straightforward layout. The use of a single pattern for all bars maintains consistency, and the values are directly labeled on the bars, making it easy to compare the number of students across different cities. The title is descriptive, and the scale is appropriate for the data presented.

Model: gpt-4o-mini
Readability Score: 4/5
Score Reason: The visualization presents a clear comparison of student numbers across different cities. The horizontal bar chart format is effective for this type of data, and the labels are legible. However, the use of a hatched pattern for the bars may reduce clarity slightly, as it can be harder to gauge the exact values compared to solid colors. Overall, the chart is still quite readable.
