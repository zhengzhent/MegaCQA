Readability Score: 4/5
Score Reason: The chart is well-organized with clear labels and a straightforward layout. The use of a consistent pattern for the bars makes it easy to compare the number of artworks across different cities. The numerical values are directly placed at the end of each bar, which aids in quick interpretation. The axis labels and title are clear and informative.

Model: gpt-4o-mini
Readability Score: 4/5
Score Reason: The visualization effectively uses horizontal bars to represent the number of artworks created across different cities, making it easy to compare values. The labels are clear, and the scale is appropriately marked, allowing for quick interpretation of the data. However, the use of filled blocks instead of solid bars may slightly hinder readability, but overall, it remains quite accessible.
