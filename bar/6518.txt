Model: Qwen/Qwen2.5-VL-72B-Instruct
Readability Score: 4/5
Score Reason: The chart is clear and well-organized, with each bar representing a town's hospital visits. The use of a gradient color scheme adds visual interest without detracting from the data. The labels are legible, and the values are directly placed on top of each bar, making it easy to understand the number of visits for each town. The title and axis labels are clear and informative.

Model: gpt-4o-mini
Readability Score: 4/5
Score Reason: The visualization effectively uses a bar chart format to display hospital visit data across different towns. The color gradient is visually appealing, but it may distract from the actual data values. The labels for the towns and the y-axis are clear, and the data values are directly on the bars, making it easy to read. However, the use of similar shades of orange could make it difficult for some viewers to differentiate between the bars at a glance, especially in a printed format. Overall, it is mostly clear but has minor readability issues.
