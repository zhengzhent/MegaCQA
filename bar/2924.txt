Model: Qwen/Qwen2.5-VL-72B-Instruct
Readability Score: 4/5
Score Reason: The chart is clear and straightforward, with each bar representing a city and its corresponding number of artworks. The bars are evenly spaced, and the numbers are placed at the top of each bar, making it easy to read the exact values. The title and axis labels are clear and provide context for the data. The use of a single pattern for all bars maintains simplicity and avoids unnecessary complexity.

Model: gpt-4o-mini
Readability Score: 4/5
Score Reason: The chart presents the data in a clear bar format, with distinct labels for each city and corresponding values on the bars. However, the use of diagonal lines on the bars may detract from readability, making it slightly harder to discern the exact values at a glance. Overall, the chart is still fairly easy to interpret despite this minor issue.
