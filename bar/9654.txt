Model: Qwen/Qwen2.5-VL-72B-Instruct
Readability Score: 4/5
Score Reason: The chart is well-organized with clear labels and distinct colors for each month, which helps in distinguishing the data easily. The values are directly written on top of each bar, making it straightforward to read the exact figures. However, the months are not in chronological order, which might cause a slight confusion for the reader when trying to understand the trend over time.
