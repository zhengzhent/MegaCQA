Model: Qwen/Qwen2.5-VL-72B-Instruct
Readability Score: 4/5
Score Reason: The chart uses a consistent and clear bar format with labels for each energy source, making it easy to compare their consumption levels. The use of a single pattern for all bars simplifies the visual complexity, and the numerical values at the end of each bar provide precise data, enhancing readability. However, the chart could be improved by using color coding or different patterns for better differentiation between categories.

Model: gpt-4o-mini
Readability Score: 3/5
Score Reason: The visualization presents energy consumption data in a horizontal bar chart format, which is generally effective for comparison. However, the use of hatched patterns instead of solid colors makes it difficult to quickly discern the lengths of the bars, and the labels are somewhat cluttered. Additionally, the y-axis labels are not clearly aligned with the corresponding bars, which can lead to confusion. Overall, while the data is present, the readability is compromised by these design choices.
