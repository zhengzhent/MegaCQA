Model: Qwen/Qwen2.5-VL-72B-Instruct
Readability Score: 4/5
Score Reason: The chart uses distinct colors for each month, which helps in distinguishing the data easily. The labels are clear and the values are directly written on the bars, making it straightforward to understand the sales figures. However, the months are not in chronological order, which might cause a slight confusion for the viewer.

Model: gpt-4o-mini
Readability Score: 4/5
Score Reason: The visualization effectively uses horizontal bars to represent monthly sales figures, making it easy to compare values across months. The color coding is distinct, and the labels are clear and legible. However, the y-axis labels could be more prominent, and the title could be better positioned for improved visibility. Overall, it is quite readable.
