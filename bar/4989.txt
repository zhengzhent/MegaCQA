Model: Qwen/Qwen2.5-VL-72B-Instruct
Readability Score: 4/5
Score Reason: The chart is clear and well-organized, with distinct bars for each energy type. The use of a gradient color scheme adds visual interest without compromising clarity. The labels are legible, and the values are directly placed on top of each bar, making it easy to understand the data at a glance.

Model: gpt-4o-mini
Readability Score: 4/5
Score Reason: The visualization effectively uses a bar chart to represent energy consumption data, with clear labels for each energy type and corresponding values displayed on top of the bars. The color gradient is visually appealing, but the use of a red color scheme may not be the best choice for clarity, as it can be difficult for some viewers to distinguish between the bars. Overall, the chart is mostly readable, but the color choice slightly detracts from its effectiveness.
