Model: Qwen/Qwen2.5-VL-72B-Instruct
Readability Score: 4/5
Score Reason: The chart is clear and well-organized, with each company's revenue data presented in a bar format. The use of a consistent pattern on the bars helps in maintaining visual uniformity. The labels for both the x-axis (company names) and y-axis (revenue in million USD) are legible and appropriately placed. The values are also directly written on top of each bar, making it easy to read the exact revenue figures. However, the x-axis labels are slightly tilted, which might require a bit more effort to read for some viewers.

Model: gpt-4o-mini
Readability Score: 3/5
Score Reason: The chart presents the annual revenue data clearly with distinct bars for each company. However, the use of hatch patterns instead of solid colors makes it harder to differentiate between the bars, especially in a crowded space. The numerical values on top of the bars are legible, but the overall visual complexity could be simplified for better readability.
