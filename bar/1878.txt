Model: Qwen/Qwen2.5-VL-72B-Instruct
Readability Score: 4/5
Score Reason: The chart is clear and straightforward, with each company's revenue data presented in a bar format. The bars are evenly spaced, and the revenue values are clearly labeled on top of each bar. The axis labels are legible, and the title provides a clear context for the data. However, the use of a monochrome color scheme might make it slightly less visually engaging compared to a chart with varied colors.
