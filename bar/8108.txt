Model: Qwen/Qwen2.5-VL-72B-Instruct
Readability Score: 4/5
Score Reason: The chart is clear and straightforward, with each bar representing a different type of house and its corresponding sales value in thousand USD. The labels are legible, and the values are directly placed on top of each bar, making it easy to understand the data at a glance. The use of a consistent pattern for all bars maintains uniformity, and the title clearly states the context of the data.

Model: gpt-4o-mini
Readability Score: 4/5
Score Reason: The chart presents the data clearly with distinct bars for each house type, and the values are labeled on top of the bars, making it easy to read. However, the use of diagonal lines for shading may slightly detract from clarity, but overall, the visualization is still quite effective.
