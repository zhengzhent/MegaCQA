Model: Qwen/Qwen2.5-VL-72B-Instruct
Readability Score: 4/5
Score Reason: The chart is straightforward with clear labels for both the x-axis and y-axis. The data values are directly written on top of each bar, which makes it easy to read the exact figures. The use of a single pattern for all bars keeps the chart simple and avoids unnecessary complexity. The title clearly states the context of the data.

Model: gpt-4o-mini
Readability Score: 4/5
Score Reason: The chart presents the data clearly with distinct bars for each property type, and the values are labeled directly on the bars, which aids in quick comprehension. However, the use of diagonal hatching may reduce clarity slightly, and the rotation of the x-axis labels could make them harder to read. Overall, the visualization is fairly easy to interpret.
