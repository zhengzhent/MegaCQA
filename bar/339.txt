Model: gpt-4o-mini
Readability Score: 4/5
Score Reason: The chart presents the data clearly with distinct bars for each crop category. However, the use of diagonal lines for shading may make it slightly harder to differentiate between the bars at a glance. The axis labels and titles are clear, but the numbers on the bars could be more prominent to enhance readability.
