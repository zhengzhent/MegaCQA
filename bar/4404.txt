Model: Qwen/Qwen2.5-VL-72B-Instruct
Readability Score: 5/5
Score Reason: The chart is well-organized with clear labels and distinct colors for each energy type. The values are directly displayed on the bars, making it easy to compare the energy consumption of different types. The scale is appropriate, and the chart is not cluttered.

Model: gpt-4o-mini
Readability Score: 3/5
Score Reason: The visualization effectively uses color coding to differentiate between various energy sources, and the labels are clear and easy to read. However, the extreme difference in the values, particularly the significantly larger value for Biofuel, creates a visual imbalance that may make it difficult for viewers to accurately compare the other energy sources. This could lead to misinterpretation of the data.
