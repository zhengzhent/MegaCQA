--------------------------------------------------
Model: Qwen/Qwen2.5-VL-72B-Instruct
Readability Score: 4/5
Score Reason: The chart is relatively easy to read with clear labels for both the x-axis and y-axis. The use of a consistent pattern for the bars helps in distinguishing them from the background. However, the text labels on the x-axis are slightly tilted, which might make it a bit harder to read the city names. The values are directly written on top of the bars, which is helpful for precise data reading. The title clearly states the context of the data.

Model: gpt-4o-mini
Readability Score: 2/5
Score Reason: The visualization presents a significant disparity in R&D investment across cities, but the use of diagonal lines in the bars makes it difficult to accurately gauge the values. Additionally, the y-axis labels are cluttered and the scale is not intuitive, which can confuse the reader. The chart lacks color differentiation, making it harder to distinguish between the cities at a glance.
