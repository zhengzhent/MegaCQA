Model: Qwen/Qwen2.5-VL-72B-Instruct
Readability Score: 4/5
Score Reason: The chart is clear and well-organized, with each bar representing a different attraction and its corresponding number of visitors. The use of consistent patterns on the bars helps in distinguishing them from each other. The labels are legible, and the values are directly placed on top of each bar, making it easy to read the exact number of visitors. The title and axis labels are clear and provide context for the data.

Model: gpt-4o-mini
Readability Score: 4/5
Score Reason: The chart effectively presents the data with clear labels for both the attractions and the number of visitors. The use of a consistent scale on the y-axis allows for easy comparison between the attractions. However, the diagonal text for the attraction names may hinder readability slightly, and the striped pattern on the bars could be confusing for some viewers. Overall, it is still relatively easy to interpret.
