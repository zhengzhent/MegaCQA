Model: Qwen/Qwen2.5-VL-72B-Instruct
Readability Score: 4/5
Score Reason: The bar chart is straightforward and easy to interpret. The bars are clearly labeled with the number of visits, and the use of a consistent pattern makes it visually cohesive. The axis labels are legible, and the title clearly states the data being represented. There is no clutter, and the differences in the number of visits between towns are easily discernible.

Model: gpt-4o-mini
Readability Score: 4/5
Score Reason: The chart presents the data clearly with distinct bars for each town, and the values are labeled on top of the bars, making it easy to read. However, the use of diagonal hatching may slightly reduce clarity compared to solid colors. Overall, the chart is still quite readable.
