Readability Score: 4/5

Model: gpt-4o-mini
Readability Score: 2/5
Score Reason: The visualization uses star symbols to represent data, which can be visually appealing but makes it difficult to accurately gauge the values at a glance. The lack of color differentiation and the crowded layout with long labels can lead to confusion. Additionally, the scale on the x-axis is not clearly marked, making it harder to interpret the exact visitor numbers.
