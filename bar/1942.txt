Model: gpt-4o-mini
Readability Score: 4/5
Score Reason: The visualization effectively uses a horizontal bar chart to display the annual revenue data of various companies. The colors are distinct and help differentiate between the companies. The labels are clear, and the values are easily readable. However, the presence of a significant outlier (QuantumX) may distract from the overall comparison, but it does not severely impact readability.
