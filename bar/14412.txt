Model: Qwen/Qwen2.5-VL-72B-Instruct
Readability Score: 4/5
Score Reason: The chart is straightforward and easy to interpret. The bars are clearly labeled with the corresponding farm names and the exact values in tons are displayed on top of each bar. The use of a grid pattern within the bars adds a unique visual element but does not detract from the clarity. The title and axis labels are clear and provide context for the data.

Model: gpt-4o-mini
Readability Score: 4/5
Score Reason: The chart presents the data clearly with well-defined bars and labels. The use of a grid helps in estimating the values, and the titles are appropriately placed. However, the rotation of the x-axis labels makes it slightly harder to read. Overall, the visualization is effective in conveying the information.
