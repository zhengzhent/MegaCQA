Readability Score: 4/5
Score Reason: The bar chart is clear and well-organized, with each company's revenue data distinctly represented. The use of consistent patterns on the bars helps in maintaining uniformity, and the labels are legible. The values are directly placed on top of the bars, making it easy to read the exact revenue figures. The chart title and axis labels are clear and informative.

Model: gpt-4o-mini
Readability Score: 4/5
Score Reason: The chart presents the annual revenue data clearly with well-defined bars and labels. However, the use of diagonal lines in the bars may distract from the actual values, making it slightly harder to read the exact figures. The axis labels and titles are clear, but the overall readability is affected by the pattern used in the bars.
