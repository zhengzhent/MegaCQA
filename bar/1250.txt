Model: Qwen/Qwen2.5-VL-72B-Instruct
Readability Score: 4/5
Score Reason: The bar chart is clear and well-organized, with each company's revenue data distinctly represented. The use of a consistent pattern on the bars helps in maintaining uniformity, and the numerical values are clearly labeled on top of each bar. The axis labels and title are legible and provide necessary context. However, the x-axis labels are slightly tilted, which might make them a bit harder to read at a glance.

Model: gpt-4o-mini
Readability Score: 3/5
Score Reason: The chart presents the annual revenue data clearly with distinct bars for each company. However, the use of hatch patterns instead of solid colors may make it harder for some viewers to differentiate between the bars, especially in a printed format. The numerical values on top of the bars are helpful, but the overall readability could be improved with better color contrast and a cleaner design.
