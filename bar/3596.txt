Model: Qwen/Qwen2.5-VL-72B-Instruct
Readability Score: 4/5
Score Reason: The chart is clear and well-organized, with each city's student population easily distinguishable by the height of the bars. The use of a consistent pattern on the bars and clear labeling of both axes and data points enhances readability. The title is descriptive, and the scale is appropriate for the data presented.

Model: gpt-4o-mini
Readability Score: 4/5
Score Reason: The chart presents a clear comparison of student numbers across different cities, with well-defined bars and labels. However, the use of diagonal lines within the bars may distract from the actual values, making it slightly harder to read. The numbers on top of the bars are helpful, but the overall design could be simplified for better clarity.
