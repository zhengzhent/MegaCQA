Model: Qwen/Qwen2.5-VL-72B-Instruct
Readability Score: 4/5
Score Reason: The chart is well-organized with clear labels and distinct colors for each bar, making it easy to differentiate between months. The values are directly written on top of each bar, which aids in quick data interpretation. However, the months are not in chronological order, which might cause a slight confusion for the reader.

Model: gpt-4o-mini
Readability Score: 4/5
Score Reason: The visualization effectively presents monthly online sales figures with clear labeling of months and corresponding sales values. The use of distinct colors for each bar aids in differentiation, and the scale on the y-axis is appropriately labeled, making it easy to interpret the data. However, the height of the December bar may overshadow other months, which could lead to misinterpretation of the overall trends. Overall, it is still quite readable.
