Model: Qwen/Qwen2.5-VL-72B-Instruct
Readability Score: 5/5
Score Reason: The chart is clear and well-organized, with distinct bars for each company's revenue. The use of a gradient color scheme adds visual interest without detracting from readability. The labels are legible, and the values are directly placed on top of each bar, making it easy to understand the revenue figures at a glance. The title and axis labels are clear and informative.

Model: gpt-4o-mini
Readability Score: 4/5
Score Reason: The visualization effectively uses a bar chart to represent the annual revenue data of different companies. The bars are clearly labeled with both company names and revenue figures, making it easy to compare values. However, the grayscale color scheme may reduce visual contrast, making it slightly harder to distinguish between the bars at a glance. Overall, the chart is still quite readable.
