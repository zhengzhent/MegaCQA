Model: Qwen/Qwen2.5-VL-72B-Instruct
Readability Score: 4/5
Score Reason: The chart is relatively easy to read with clear labels and distinct colors for each bar. However, the months are not in chronological order, which can be slightly confusing. The values are directly labeled on the bars, which aids in quick comprehension. The title and axis labels are clear and informative.

Model: gpt-4o-mini
Readability Score: 4/5
Score Reason: The visualization effectively presents monthly online sales figures with clear bar representations for each month. The use of distinct colors for each bar enhances differentiation, and the labels are legible. However, the y-axis scale could be misleading as it does not start from zero, which may distort the perception of the data. Overall, it is mostly clear and interpretable.
