Model: Qwen/Qwen2.5-VL-72B-Instruct
Readability Score: 5/5
Score Reason: The chart is clear and well-organized, with each bar representing a city's student population in thousands. The use of a gradient color scheme adds visual interest without detracting from the data. The labels are legible, and the values are directly placed on top of each bar, making it easy to compare the number of students across different cities.

Model: gpt-4o-mini
Readability Score: 4/5
Score Reason: The visualization effectively uses a bar chart to compare the number of students across different cities. The bars are clearly labeled with both city names and corresponding values, making it easy to interpret the data. The color gradient enhances visual appeal without compromising clarity. However, the x-axis labels are slightly tilted, which may cause minor readability issues for some viewers. Overall, the chart is quite readable.
