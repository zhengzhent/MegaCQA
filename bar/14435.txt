Model: Qwen/Qwen2.5-VL-72B-Instruct
Readability Score: 4/5
Score Reason: The chart is clear and well-organized, with each bar representing a different farm's fruit transportation flow in tons. The bars are evenly spaced, and the values are directly labeled on top of each bar, making it easy to read the exact figures. The title and axis labels are clear and provide context for the data. The use of a single color with a grid pattern does not distract from the data.
