Model: Qwen/Qwen2.5-VL-72B-Instruct
Readability Score: 4/5
Score Reason: The chart is clear and well-organized, with a straightforward bar representation of R&D investment across various cities. The use of a gradient color scheme adds visual interest without detracting from the data. The labels are legible, and the values are directly placed on top of the bars, making it easy to understand the investment amounts at a glance. However, the similarity in bar heights for most cities might make it slightly less intuitive to compare the investments between cities with similar values.

Model: gpt-4o-mini
Readability Score: 4/5
Score Reason: The visualization effectively uses a bar chart to represent R&D investment across cities, with clear labels for both the cities and the investment amounts. However, the color gradient from red to white may not provide enough contrast for some viewers, potentially making it harder to distinguish between the values. The values are displayed on top of the bars, which aids readability, but the overall color scheme could be improved for better clarity.
