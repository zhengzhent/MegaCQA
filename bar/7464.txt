Model: Qwen/Qwen2.5-VL-72B-Instruct
Readability Score: 4/5
Score Reason: The bar chart is clear and well-organized, with each company's employee count distinctly represented. The use of a consistent pattern for the bars maintains uniformity, and the labels are legible. The numerical values are directly placed on top of each bar, making it easy to read the exact number of employees for each company. The title and axis labels are clear and informative.

Model: gpt-4o-mini
Readability Score: 3/5
Score Reason: The chart presents the data in a clear bar format, but the use of diagonal lines in the bars makes it difficult to accurately gauge the height of each bar. Additionally, the font size of the labels is relatively small, which may hinder readability. The overall layout is organized, but the visual elements detract from the ease of interpretation.
