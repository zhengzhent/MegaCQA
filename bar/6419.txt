Model: Qwen/Qwen2.5-VL-72B-Instruct
Readability Score: 4/5
Score Reason: The chart is well-organized with clear labels and distinct colors for each town, making it easy to differentiate between data sets. The values are directly labeled on the bars, which enhances readability. However, the large difference in values, especially for Elmwood, makes it a bit challenging to compare the smaller values effectively.
