Model: Qwen/Qwen2.5-VL-72B-Instruct
Readability Score: 4/5
Score Reason: The chart uses distinct colors for each month, which helps in distinguishing the data visually. The labels are clear and the values are directly written on the bars, making it easy to read the exact figures. However, the months are not in chronological order, which might cause a slight confusion for the reader when trying to analyze trends over time.

Readability Score: 4/5
Score Reason: The visualization effectively uses horizontal bars to represent monthly sales figures, making it easy to compare values across different months. The color coding is distinct, and the labels are clear and legible. However, the chart could benefit from a more consistent color scheme and a clearer title to enhance understanding. Overall, it is quite readable.
