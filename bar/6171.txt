Model: Qwen/Qwen2.5-VL-72B-Instruct
Readability Score: 4/5
Score Reason: The chart uses a clear horizontal bar format with distinct colors for each town, making it easy to differentiate between data sets. The labels for both the towns and the number of visits are legible and well-placed. The scale on the x-axis is appropriately spaced, allowing for easy comparison of the number of visits. However, the use of different colors for each bar, while visually appealing, does not add functional value and could be simplified for better consistency.

Model: gpt-4o-mini
Readability Score: 4/5
Score Reason: The visualization is clear and effectively uses horizontal bars to represent the data, making it easy to compare the number of hospital visits across different towns. The color differentiation is helpful, and the labels are legible. However, the chart could benefit from a more consistent color scheme and clearer axis labels to enhance readability further.
