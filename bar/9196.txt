Model: Qwen/Qwen2.5-VL-72B-Instruct
Readability Score: 3/5
Score Reason: The chart uses a consistent pattern for all bars, which can make it harder to distinguish between different months at a glance. The months are not in chronological order, which can be confusing. However, the values are clearly labeled at the end of each bar, and the scale is easy to follow. The title is clear and provides context for the data.

Model: gpt-4o-mini
Readability Score: 2/5
Score Reason: The visualization presents the monthly online sales figures in a horizontal bar chart format. However, the use of hatched patterns instead of solid colors makes it difficult to quickly discern the values represented. Additionally, the numbers are placed at the end of the bars, which can lead to misinterpretation if the viewer does not closely align the numbers with the corresponding bars. The overall layout is somewhat cluttered, and the axis labels could be clearer. Therefore, the readability is compromised.
