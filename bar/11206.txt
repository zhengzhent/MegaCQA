Model: Qwen/Qwen2.5-VL-72B-Instruct
Readability Score: 4/5
Score Reason: The chart is clear and well-organized, with each bar representing a different video sharing platform. The use of a consistent pattern on the bars helps in maintaining visual uniformity. The labels are legible, and the values are directly placed on top of each bar, making it easy to understand the number of views for each platform. The title and axis labels are clear and provide context for the data.

Model: gpt-4o-mini
Readability Score: 4/5
Score Reason: The chart effectively presents the number of plays across different platforms with clear labels and a straightforward layout. The use of a consistent scale on the y-axis allows for easy comparison between platforms. However, the pattern of hatching in the bars may slightly detract from clarity, as it can be visually overwhelming. Overall, the information is still accessible and interpretable.
