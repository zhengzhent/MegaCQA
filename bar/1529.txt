Readability Score: 4/5
Score Reason: The visualization effectively presents the annual revenue data with clear labels for each company and corresponding revenue values. The use of a bar chart format allows for easy comparison between companies. However, the hatched pattern on the bars may slightly reduce clarity compared to solid colors, but overall, the chart remains readable and interpretable.
