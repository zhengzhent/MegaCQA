Model: Qwen/Qwen2.5-VL-72B-Instruct
Readability Score: 4/5
Score Reason: The chart is well-organized with clear labels and a straightforward layout. The use of diagonal lines for shading adds a visual element without cluttering the chart. The values are directly placed at the end of each bar, making it easy to read the exact number of visitors for each attraction. The title and axis labels are clear and informative.

Model: gpt-4o-mini
Readability Score: 4/5
Score Reason: The visualization effectively uses horizontal bars to represent the number of visitors to various attractions, making it easy to compare values. However, the use of hatched patterns instead of solid colors can make it harder to distinguish between the bars, especially in a printed format. The labels are clear, but the overall readability is slightly compromised by the pattern choice.
