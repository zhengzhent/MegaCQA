--------------------------------------------------
Model: Qwen/Qwen2.5-VL-72B-Instruct
Readability Score: 4/5
Score Reason: The chart is clear and well-organized, with each bar representing a town's hospital visits. The use of a consistent pattern on the bars helps in maintaining uniformity. The labels for both the x-axis (town names) and y-axis (number of visits) are legible, and the numerical values are displayed on top of each bar, making it easy to compare the data at a glance. However, the x-axis labels are slightly tilted, which might make it a bit challenging to read for some users.

Model: gpt-4o-mini
Readability Score: 4/5
Score Reason: The chart presents a clear comparison of hospital visits across different towns, with well-defined bars and labels. However, the use of diagonal hatching on the bars may detract from readability, making it slightly harder to discern the exact values at a glance. The y-axis is appropriately scaled, but the large discrepancy in values (especially with Mapleton) could lead to misinterpretation of the data. Overall, it is fairly easy to read but has some minor issues.
