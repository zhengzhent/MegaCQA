Model: Qwen/Qwen2.5-VL-72B-Instruct
Readability Score: 4/5
Score Reason: The chart is straightforward and easy to interpret. The bars are clearly labeled with the farm names and the corresponding values are displayed on top of each bar, making it easy to compare the fruit transportation flow between different farms. The use of a consistent pattern for all bars maintains uniformity, and the axis labels are clear and legible.

Model: gpt-4o-mini
Readability Score: 2/5
Score Reason: The chart presents the data in a bar format, but the use of diagonal lines for shading makes it difficult to quickly discern the values. Additionally, the labels for the farms are tilted, which can hinder readability. The overall layout is somewhat cluttered, and the values are not clearly associated with their respective bars, making it challenging to interpret the data at a glance.
