--------------------------------------------------
Model: Qwen/Qwen2.5-VL-72B-Instruct
Readability Score: 4/5
Score Reason: The visualization uses a clear bar chart format with distinct colors for each bar, which helps in differentiating the data for each month. The values are directly labeled on top of each bar, making it easy to read the exact figures. However, the months are not in chronological order, which can be slightly confusing. Overall, the chart is quite readable.

Model: gpt-4o-mini
Readability Score: 4/5
Score Reason: The chart effectively uses distinct colors for each month, making it easy to differentiate between the data points. The labels are clear and legible, and the y-axis is appropriately scaled to show the sales figures without clutter. However, the height of the bars for some months is quite close, which may require careful observation to discern small differences. Overall, the visualization is straightforward and conveys the information well.
