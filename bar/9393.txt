--------------------------------------------------
Model: Qwen/Qwen2.5-VL-72B-Instruct
Readability Score: 4/5
Score Reason: The chart is relatively simple and uses clear labels for both the x-axis and y-axis. The values are directly written on top of the bars, which makes it easy to read the exact figures. However, the months are not in chronological order, which might cause a slight confusion for the reader. The use of a single pattern for all bars does not affect readability negatively in this case.

Model: gpt-4o-mini
Readability Score: 4/5
Score Reason: The chart presents the monthly online sales figures clearly, with distinct bars for each month. However, the use of diagonal hatching makes it slightly harder to interpret the values at a glance compared to solid colors. The labels are clear, but the overall design could be improved for better visual impact.
