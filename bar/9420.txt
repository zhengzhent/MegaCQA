Model: Qwen/Qwen2.5-VL-72B-Instruct
Readability Score: 4/5
Score Reason: The chart uses distinct colors for each bar, which helps in distinguishing the data for different months. However, the months are not in chronological order, which can be confusing. The labels are clear and the values are directly on the bars, making it easy to read the exact figures. The title and axis labels are also clear and informative.
