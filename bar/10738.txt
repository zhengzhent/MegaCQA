Model: Qwen/Qwen2.5-VL-72B-Instruct
Readability Score: 4/5
Score Reason: The chart is clear and well-organized, with distinct bars for each city and clear labeling of the R&D investment values. The use of a gradient color scheme adds visual interest without detracting from the data. The title and axis labels are legible and provide context for the data presented. However, the gradient might not add significant value to the data interpretation.

Model: gpt-4o-mini
Readability Score: 3/5
Score Reason: The visualization effectively presents the data with clear labels for each city and a straightforward y-axis indicating investment amounts. However, the gradient color scheme may make it difficult for some viewers to distinguish between the bars, especially for those with color vision deficiencies. Additionally, the values on top of the bars are not consistently formatted, which could lead to confusion. Overall, while the chart is mostly readable, the color choice and formatting issues detract from its clarity.
