Model: gpt-4o-mini
Readability Score: 4/5
Score Reason: The visualization effectively uses a bar chart to represent sales figures across different food categories. The color gradient is visually appealing, but it may slightly detract from the clarity of the data values displayed on the bars. However, the labels are clear, and the y-axis is appropriately scaled, making it easy to compare the sales figures. Overall, the chart is quite readable.
