Model: gpt-4o-mini
Readability Score: 4/5
Score Reason: The chart presents the data clearly with well-defined bars for each town, and the y-axis is appropriately labeled with a clear scale. However, the use of grid lines and the font size of the numbers on the bars may make it slightly cluttered. Overall, the information is still interpretable at a glance, but minor adjustments could enhance clarity.
