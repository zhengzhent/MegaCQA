Model: Qwen/Qwen2.5-VL-72B-Instruct
Readability Score: 4/5
Score Reason: The chart is clear and well-organized, with each bar representing a different video sharing platform. The use of a consistent pattern within the bars helps in maintaining uniformity. The labels on the x-axis are legible, and the y-axis is clearly labeled with 'thousand views'. The values are directly written on top of each bar, making it easy to read the exact number of views for each platform. The title is descriptive and provides context for the data presented.

Model: gpt-4o-mini
Readability Score: 4/5
Score Reason: The chart effectively presents the number of plays across different video sharing platforms with clear labels and a straightforward bar format. The use of a consistent scale on the y-axis allows for easy comparison between platforms. However, the lack of color differentiation and the crowded appearance of the bars may slightly hinder readability, but overall, the information is still accessible.
