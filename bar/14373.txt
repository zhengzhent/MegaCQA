Model: Qwen/Qwen2.5-VL-72B-Instruct
Readability Score: 4/5
Score Reason: The chart is clear and well-organized, with each bar representing a different farm's fruit transportation flow in tons. The bars are labeled with their respective values, making it easy to compare the amounts at a glance. The use of a consistent pattern for the bars and a straightforward axis labeling enhances readability. However, the bars are quite close together, which might make it slightly challenging to distinguish between adjacent bars for some viewers.

Model: gpt-4o-mini
Readability Score: 4/5
Score Reason: The chart presents the data clearly with well-defined bars for each farm, and the values are labeled directly on the bars, making it easy to read. However, the use of diagonal lines in the bars may slightly detract from clarity, but overall, the visualization is still quite effective.
