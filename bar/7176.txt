Model: Qwen/Qwen2.5-VL-72B-Instruct
Readability Score: 4/5
Score Reason: The chart uses distinct colors for each company, which helps in differentiating the data sets. The labels are clear and the numbers of employees are directly written on the bars, making it easy to read the exact values. The x-axis is well-defined with a clear scale, and the title provides a good context for the data. However, the chart could be improved by adding a legend to explain the color coding.

Model: gpt-4o-mini
Readability Score: 4/5
Score Reason: The visualization effectively uses horizontal bars to represent the number of employees in different companies, making it easy to compare values at a glance. The color differentiation is clear, and the labels are legible. However, the chart could benefit from a more consistent color scheme and clearer axis labeling to enhance readability further.
