Model: Qwen/Qwen2.5-VL-72B-Instruct
Readability Score: 4/5
Score Reason: The chart is clear and well-organized, with each company's revenue data presented in a bar format. The use of stars as a fill pattern adds a unique visual element without compromising clarity. The labels for both the x-axis and y-axis are legible, and the revenue values are directly written on top of each bar, making it easy to understand the data at a glance. The spacing between bars is adequate, preventing any overlap or clutter.

Model: gpt-4o-mini
Readability Score: 2/5
Score Reason: The visualization uses a star pattern for the bars, which can be visually distracting and makes it difficult to accurately gauge the height of each bar. Additionally, the values are displayed on top of the bars, but the star pattern may obscure the numbers, leading to potential misinterpretation. The overall layout is somewhat cluttered, which detracts from readability.
