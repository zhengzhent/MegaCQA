Model: Qwen/Qwen2.5-VL-72B-Instruct
Readability Score: 4/5
Score Reason: The chart is clear and well-organized, with distinct bars for each crop category. The use of a gradient color scheme adds visual interest without compromising clarity. The labels for both the x-axis and y-axis are legible, and the values are directly placed on top of each bar, making it easy to understand the production quantities at a glance.

Model: gpt-4o-mini
Readability Score: 4/5
Score Reason: The visualization effectively presents the production of different crops with clear labels and a straightforward bar chart format. The gradient color scheme is visually appealing, but it may slightly detract from the clarity of the data values. However, the values are still readable, and the overall structure allows for easy comparison between the crops.
