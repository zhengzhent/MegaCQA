Model: Qwen/Qwen2.5-VL-72B-Instruct
Readability Score: 4/5
Score Reason: The chart is clear and well-organized, with distinct bars for each food category. The use of a consistent pattern (stars) across all bars maintains uniformity, and the values are clearly labeled on top of each bar. The axis labels and title are legible and provide necessary context. The spacing between bars is adequate, preventing any clutter.

Model: gpt-4o-mini
Readability Score: 2/5
Score Reason: The visualization uses a patterned fill for the bars, which can distract from the actual data values. Additionally, the labels for the food categories are slightly tilted, making them harder to read. While the sales figures are displayed on top of the bars, the overall design lacks clarity and can confuse the viewer, impacting the readability negatively.
