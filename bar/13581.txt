Model: Qwen/Qwen2.5-VL-72B-Instruct
Readability Score: 4/5
Score Reason: The chart is straightforward and uses a clear bar graph format. The labels for both the x-axis and y-axis are legible, and the values are directly written on top of each bar, making it easy to understand the number of visitors for each attraction. The use of a consistent pattern for all bars maintains uniformity, and the spacing between bars is adequate for easy comparison.

Model: gpt-4o-mini
Readability Score: 4/5
Score Reason: The chart effectively presents the data with clear labels for each attraction and a straightforward y-axis indicating the number of visitors. However, the use of decimal numbers for visitor counts may confuse some readers, and the striped pattern on the bars does not enhance readability. Overall, it is relatively easy to interpret but could be improved.
