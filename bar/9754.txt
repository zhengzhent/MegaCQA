--------------------------------------------------
Model: Qwen/Qwen2.5-VL-72B-Instruct
Readability Score: 4/5
Score Reason: The chart is clear and straightforward, with each bar representing monthly sales figures. The values are directly labeled on top of each bar, making it easy to read the exact figures. The months are clearly marked on the x-axis, and the y-axis is labeled with a clear unit (thousand USD). However, the months are not in chronological order, which might cause a slight confusion for the reader when trying to understand the trend over time.

Model: gpt-4o-mini
Readability Score: 4/5
Score Reason: The chart presents the monthly online sales figures clearly, with well-defined bars and a straightforward labeling of months and values. However, the use of a vertical axis with a large range and the absence of color differentiation may make it slightly harder to quickly interpret the differences in sales figures at a glance. Overall, it is still quite readable.
