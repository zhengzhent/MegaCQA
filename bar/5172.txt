Model: Qwen/Qwen2.5-VL-72B-Instruct
Readability Score: 4/5
Score Reason: The chart is clear and well-organized, with distinct bars for each food category. The use of a gradient color scheme adds visual interest without compromising clarity. The labels are legible, and the values are directly placed on top of each bar, making it easy to understand the sales figures at a glance. The title and axis labels are also clear and informative.

Model: gpt-4o-mini
Readability Score: 4/5
Score Reason: The visualization effectively uses a simple bar chart format to display sales figures across different food categories. The labels are clear, and the numerical values on top of the bars provide precise information. However, the grayscale color scheme may make it difficult for some viewers to distinguish between the bars, especially in a printed format. Overall, the chart is mostly readable but could benefit from more contrasting colors.
