Model: Qwen/Qwen2.5-VL-72B-Instruct
Readability Score: 5/5
Score Reason: The chart is well-organized with clear labels and a straightforward bar representation. The use of a gradient color scheme adds visual interest without detracting from the data. The values are directly labeled on each bar, making it easy to read the exact sales figures. The title and axis labels are clear and informative.

Model: gpt-4o-mini
Readability Score: 4/5
Score Reason: The visualization effectively uses a bar chart to represent sales figures across different food categories. The labels for each category are clear and easy to read, and the numerical values on top of the bars provide immediate insight into the sales figures. However, the color gradient from light to dark red may not be the best choice for clarity, as it could be misinterpreted by some viewers. Overall, the chart is mostly readable with minor issues.
