Model: Qwen/Qwen2.5-VL-72B-Instruct
Readability Score: 4/5
Score Reason: The chart is straightforward and uses a clear bar graph format to represent the number of hospital visits in different towns. The bars are well-spaced, and the numbers of visits are directly labeled on top of each bar, making it easy to compare the data. The gradient color in the bars adds a visual element but does not detract from the readability. The axis labels and title are clear and informative.

Model: gpt-4o-mini
Readability Score: 4/5
Score Reason: The chart effectively presents the data with clear labels for each town and corresponding visit numbers. However, the gradient fill on the bars may distract from the actual values, and the rotation of the x-axis labels makes them slightly harder to read. Overall, the information is still interpretable, but the design choices could be improved for better clarity.
