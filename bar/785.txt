Readability Score: 4/5
Score Reason: The chart is clear and straightforward, with distinct bars for each crop category. The use of diagonal lines for shading adds a visual element that does not detract from readability. The labels are legible, and the values are clearly marked at the end of each bar, making it easy to compare the production of different crops at a glance.

Model: gpt-4o-mini
Readability Score: 4/5
Score Reason: The visualization is straightforward, with clearly labeled axes and distinct categories for each crop. The use of horizontal bars makes it easy to compare the production values at a glance. However, the hatched pattern may slightly reduce clarity compared to solid colors, but overall, the information is still easily interpretable.
