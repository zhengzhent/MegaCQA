Model: Qwen/Qwen2.5-VL-72B-Instruct
Readability Score: 4/5
Score Reason: The chart is clear and straightforward, with distinct bars for each movie and clear labeling of both the x-axis and y-axis. The values are directly written on top of each bar, making it easy to read the exact box office numbers. The use of a gradient color scheme adds visual interest without detracting from the readability. The title is descriptive and provides context for the data.

Model: gpt-4o-mini
Readability Score: 4/5
Score Reason: The visualization effectively uses a simple bar chart format to display box office earnings, which is easy to understand. However, the use of a monochromatic color scheme may make it difficult for some viewers to distinguish between the bars, especially in a printed format. The labels are clear, and the values are directly displayed on the bars, aiding comprehension.
