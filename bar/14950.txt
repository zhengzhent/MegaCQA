Model: gpt-4o-mini
Readability Score: 2/5
Score Reason: The visualization uses a grid format to represent data, which can be visually confusing. The lack of color differentiation and the small size of the text make it difficult to quickly interpret the values. Additionally, the spacing between the farms is inconsistent, which can lead to misinterpretation of the data. Overall, the chart does not effectively communicate the information at a glance.
