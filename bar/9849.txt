Model: Qwen/Qwen2.5-VL-72B-Instruct
Readability Score: 3/5
Score Reason: The chart uses a consistent pattern for all bars, which can make it harder to distinguish between different months at a glance. The months are not in chronological order, which can be confusing. However, the labels are clear, and the values are directly written on the bars, which aids in understanding the exact figures. The scale is also well-defined.

Model: gpt-4o-mini
Readability Score: 4/5
Score Reason: The visualization presents the monthly online sales figures clearly, with a straightforward bar chart format. However, the use of hatching in the bars may reduce clarity, and the y-axis labels are not aligned with the bars, which could lead to misinterpretation. Overall, it is relatively easy to read but has some minor issues that affect its effectiveness.
