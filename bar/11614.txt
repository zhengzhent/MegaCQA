Model: Qwen/Qwen2.5-VL-72B-Instruct
Readability Score: 5/5
Score Reason: The chart is clear and well-organized, with distinct colors for each platform that make it easy to differentiate between them. The labels on the x-axis are legible, and the y-axis is clearly labeled with 'thousand views'. The values are directly written on top of each bar, which makes it easy to read the exact number of views for each platform. The title is descriptive and provides context for the data.
