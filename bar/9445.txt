Model: Qwen/Qwen2.5-VL-72B-Instruct
Readability Score: 4/5
Score Reason: The chart is clear and easy to read. Each bar is distinctly colored, and the values are labeled directly on the bars, making it straightforward to understand the sales figures for each month. The months are also clearly labeled on the x-axis, and the y-axis is well-defined with a clear scale. However, the months are not in chronological order, which might cause a slight confusion for the reader.
