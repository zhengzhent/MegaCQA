Model: Qwen/Qwen2.5-VL-72B-Instruct
Readability Score: 5/5
Score Reason: The chart is clear and well-organized, with each bar representing a different farm's fruit transportation flow in tons. The use of a gradient color scheme adds visual interest without detracting from the data. The labels for both the x-axis and y-axis are clear and legible, and the values are directly placed on top of each bar, making it easy to read the exact figures. The title is descriptive and provides context for the data.
