Readability Score: 4/5
Score Reason: The chart is clear and well-organized, with each bar representing a town's hospital visits. The use of a gradient color scheme adds visual interest without detracting from the data. The labels are legible, and the values are directly placed on top of each bar, making it easy to understand the number of visits for each town. The title and axis labels are clear and informative.

Model: gpt-4o-mini
Readability Score: 4/5
Score Reason: The visualization effectively uses a bar chart to represent hospital visits across different towns. The bars are clearly labeled with numerical values, making it easy to compare the data. However, the color gradient from dark to light red may not provide enough contrast for some viewers, potentially affecting readability. Overall, the chart is mostly clear and understandable.
