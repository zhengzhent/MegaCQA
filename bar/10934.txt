Model: Qwen/Qwen2.5-VL-72B-Instruct
Readability Score: 4/5
Score Reason: The chart is straightforward and easy to interpret. The bars are clearly labeled with the city names and the exact investment values. The use of diagonal lines for shading adds a visual element without cluttering the chart. The scale is appropriate, and the title clearly states the data being represented.

Model: gpt-4o-mini
Readability Score: 3/5
Score Reason: The chart presents the data clearly with labeled bars for each city, but the use of diagonal hatching makes it difficult to distinguish between the bars, especially for Springfield and Fairmont, which have the same value. Additionally, the y-axis scale is not clearly marked, which may lead to confusion regarding the exact values represented. Overall, while the information is present, the readability is compromised by the design choices.
