Model: Qwen/Qwen2.5-VL-72B-Instruct
Readability Score: 5/5
Score Reason: The chart is clear and well-organized, with distinct colors for each city's bar, making it easy to differentiate between them. The labels for both the x-axis (city names) and y-axis (investment in million USD) are legible and appropriately placed. The values are directly written on top of each bar, which aids in quick comprehension of the data. The title is descriptive and provides context for the data presented.

Model: gpt-4o-mini
Readability Score: 4/5
Score Reason: The visualization presents the data clearly with well-defined bars for each city, and the use of distinct colors helps differentiate between them. The axis labels are legible, and the values are displayed on top of the bars, making it easy to interpret the investment amounts. However, the presence of decimal values for some cities may slightly complicate quick comparisons, but overall, the chart remains easy to read.
