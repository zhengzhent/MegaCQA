--------------------------------------------------
Model: Qwen/Qwen2.5-VL-72B-Instruct
Readability Score: 4/5
Score Reason: The chart is clear and well-organized, with each city's student population easily distinguishable by the height of the bars. The use of a consistent pattern on the bars maintains visual uniformity, and the labels are legible. The title and axis labels are clear, providing context for the data. The only potential issue is the scale of the y-axis, which might make it a bit challenging to compare cities with significantly different student numbers, but overall, the chart is quite readable.

Model: gpt-4o-mini
Readability Score: 4/5
Score Reason: The chart presents a clear comparison of student numbers across different cities. The use of a bar chart is appropriate for this type of data, and the labels for both the cities and the number of students are legible. However, the use of diagonal lines in the bars may slightly detract from the clarity, but overall, the information is still easily interpretable.
