Model: gpt-4o-mini
Readability Score: 4/5
Score Reason: The visualization is clear and effectively presents the data with distinct colors for each company. The bar heights correspond accurately to the number of employees, and the labels are easy to read. However, the color choices could be improved for better contrast, especially for the lighter bars, which may blend into the background. Overall, it is still quite readable.
