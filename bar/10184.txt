Model: Qwen/Qwen2.5-VL-72B-Instruct
Readability Score: 4/5
Score Reason: The bar chart is clear and well-organized, with each city's R&D investment easily distinguishable. The use of consistent patterns on the bars and clear labeling of both axes and data points enhances readability. The values are directly written on top of each bar, which makes it straightforward to interpret the exact investment amounts for each city.

Model: gpt-4o-mini
Readability Score: 4/5
Score Reason: The chart presents the data clearly with well-defined bars for each city, and the values are labeled directly on top of the bars, making it easy to read the exact figures. However, the use of diagonal lines in the bars may slightly detract from the overall clarity, but it does not significantly hinder readability. The axis labels are clear, and the title provides context for the data presented.
