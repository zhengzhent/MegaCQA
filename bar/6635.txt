Score Reason: The chart is clear and well-organized, with each bar representing a town's hospital visits. The use of a gradient color scheme adds visual interest without detracting from the data. The labels for both the x-axis (town names) and y-axis (number of visits) are legible, and the exact number of visits is displayed on top of each bar, making it easy to interpret the data at a glance.
