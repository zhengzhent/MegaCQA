Model: Qwen/Qwen2.5-VL-72B-Instruct
Readability Score: 4/5
Score Reason: The chart is well-organized with clear labels and a gradient color scheme that helps in distinguishing the values. The data is presented in a horizontal bar format, which is easy to read. The values are directly labeled on the bars, making it straightforward to understand the sales figures for each month. However, the months are not in chronological order, which might cause a slight confusion for the reader.

Model: gpt-4o-mini
Readability Score: 4/5
Score Reason: The visualization effectively uses a horizontal bar chart to display monthly sales figures, which allows for easy comparison between months. The color gradient from light to dark orange helps to differentiate the bars, and the labels are clear and legible. However, the y-axis labels could be more prominent, and the overall color scheme may not be optimal for colorblind viewers. Despite these minor issues, the chart is generally easy to read and interpret.
