Model: Qwen/Qwen2.5-VL-72B-Instruct
Readability Score: 4/5
Score Reason: The chart uses distinct colors for each month, which helps in distinguishing the data sets. The labels are clear and the values are directly written on the bars, making it easy to read the exact figures. However, the months are not in chronological order, which might cause a slight confusion for the reader when trying to understand the trend over time.

Model: gpt-4o-mini
Readability Score: 4/5
Score Reason: The visualization effectively uses horizontal bars to represent monthly sales figures, making it easy to compare values across different months. The color coding is distinct and helps in differentiating the months. The labels are clear and the scale is appropriately marked, allowing for quick interpretation of the data. However, the month of June has a notably low sales figure, which may cause confusion due to its placement among higher values. Overall, the chart is mostly clear and readable.
