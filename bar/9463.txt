--------------------------------------------------
Model: Qwen/Qwen2.5-VL-72B-Instruct
Readability Score: 4/5
Score Reason: The chart uses distinct colors for each month, which helps in distinguishing the data visually. The labels are clear and the values are directly placed at the end of each bar, making it easy to read the exact figures. The title and axis labels are descriptive, providing context to the data. However, the months are not in chronological order, which might cause a slight confusion for the reader.

Model: gpt-4o-mini
Readability Score: 4/5
Score Reason: The visualization effectively uses horizontal bars to represent monthly sales figures, making it easy to compare values across months. The color differentiation is clear, and the labels are legible. However, the chart could benefit from a more consistent color scheme and clearer axis labeling to enhance overall readability.
