Model: gpt-4o-mini
Readability Score: 4/5
Score Reason: The chart effectively displays the number of artworks created across different cities with clear labels and a straightforward bar format. However, the use of a patterned fill instead of solid colors may make it slightly harder to distinguish between the bars at a glance. The axis labels and values are legible, and the overall layout is organized, making it relatively easy to interpret the data.
