Model: Qwen/Qwen2.5-VL-72B-Instruct
Readability Score: 4/5
Score Reason: The chart is clear and straightforward, with each bar representing a different crop category and its corresponding production in metric tons. The use of consistent patterns and clear labels makes it easy to distinguish between the categories. The values are directly written on top of each bar, which aids in quick comprehension. The title and axis labels are also clear and informative.

Model: gpt-4o-mini
Readability Score: 3/5
Score Reason: The chart presents the data in a clear bar format, but the use of diagonal lines for shading makes it difficult to discern the height of the bars accurately. Additionally, the numbers on top of the bars are somewhat cluttered, which can lead to misinterpretation. Overall, while the categories are labeled, the visual complexity detracts from readability.
