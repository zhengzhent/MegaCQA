Model: gpt-4o-mini
Readability Score: 4/5
Score Reason: The visualization effectively uses horizontal bars to represent the box office earnings of different movies, making it easy to compare values at a glance. The color gradient is visually appealing and helps differentiate the bars, while the labels are clear and legible. However, the lack of a clear numerical scale on the y-axis could lead to some confusion regarding the exact values represented. Overall, it is quite readable.
