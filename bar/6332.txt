--------------------------------------------------
Model: Qwen/Qwen2.5-VL-72B-Instruct
Readability Score: 4/5
Score Reason: The chart is clear and well-organized, with each bar representing a town's hospital visits. The use of stars as a pattern inside the bars adds a unique visual element without compromising clarity. The labels for both the x-axis (town names) and y-axis (number of visits) are legible, and the numerical values are directly placed on top of each bar, making it easy to understand the exact number of visits for each town. The title is descriptive and provides context for the data presented.
--------------------------------------------------
Model: gpt-4o-mini
Readability Score: 2/5
Score Reason: The visualization uses star patterns within the bars, which can make it difficult to accurately gauge the height of each bar compared to a standard bar chart. Additionally, the numbers on the bars are somewhat small and may be hard to read, especially for those with visual impairments. The overall layout is somewhat cluttered, which detracts from the clarity of the data presented.
