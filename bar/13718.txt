Model: Qwen/Qwen2.5-VL-72B-Instruct
Readability Score: 4/5
Score Reason: The chart is clear and well-organized, with each bar distinctly labeled with the number of visitors. The use of stars as a fill pattern adds visual interest without detracting from the data. The labels are legible, and the y-axis is clearly defined, making it easy to understand the scale of visitors. The spacing between bars is adequate, preventing any confusion between different attractions.

Model: gpt-4o-mini
Readability Score: 2/5
Score Reason: The visualization uses a star pattern for the bars, which can be visually distracting and makes it harder to accurately gauge the heights of the bars. Additionally, the numbers on top of the bars are not clearly legible due to the background pattern. The overall layout is somewhat cluttered, which detracts from the readability of the data presented.
