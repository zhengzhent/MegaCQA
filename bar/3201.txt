Model: Qwen/Qwen2.5-VL-72B-Instruct
Readability Score: 4/5
Score Reason: The chart is straightforward and easy to interpret. The bars are clearly labeled with the number of students, and the cities are listed along the x-axis. The use of a grid pattern within the bars adds a visual texture but does not detract from the clarity. The title and axis labels are clear and provide context for the data.
