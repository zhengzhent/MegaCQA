Readability Score: 4/5
Score Reason: The chart is visually appealing with distinct colors for each bar, which helps in distinguishing the data for different months. The values are clearly labeled on top of each bar, making it easy to read the exact figures. However, the months are not in chronological order, which might cause some confusion for the viewer. Overall, the chart is quite readable but could be improved by arranging the months in a logical sequence.
