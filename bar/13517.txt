Model: Qwen/Qwen2.5-VL-72B-Instruct
Readability Score: 4/5
Score Reason: The chart uses a consistent pattern of stars to represent the bars, which is visually interesting but may not be as intuitive as solid bars for immediate comparison. The labels are clear and the numerical values are provided for each bar, which aids in precise understanding. The chart is well-organized and the data is easy to follow.

Model: gpt-4o-mini
Readability Score: 2/5
Score Reason: The visualization uses a star-based representation for the number of visitors, which can be visually appealing but makes it difficult to accurately interpret the exact values. The stars can create confusion regarding the scale, and the numbers are placed in a way that may not be immediately clear to the reader. Additionally, the crowded layout with many attractions listed can overwhelm the viewer, making it hard to focus on specific data points.
