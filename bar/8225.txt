Model: Qwen/Qwen2.5-VL-72B-Instruct
Readability Score: 4/5
Score Reason: The chart is clear and well-organized, with each bar representing a different type of property and its corresponding sales value in thousand USD. The labels are legible, and the use of a consistent pattern on the bars helps in distinguishing them from the background. The values are directly written on top of each bar, making it easy to read the exact figures. The title and axis labels are clear and provide context for the data.

Model: gpt-4o-mini
Readability Score: 4/5
Score Reason: The visualization presents the data clearly with distinct bars for each house type, and the values are labeled directly on the bars, which aids in quick comprehension. However, the rotation of the x-axis labels makes them somewhat difficult to read, and the overall design could benefit from more contrasting colors to enhance visibility. Despite these minor issues, the essential information is still accessible.
