--------------------------------------------------
Model: Qwen/Qwen2.5-VL-72B-Instruct
Readability Score: 4/5
Score Reason: The chart is clear and straightforward, with each city's student population represented by a distinct bar. The use of diagonal lines within the bars adds a visual texture but does not detract from the readability. The labels for both the x-axis (cities) and y-axis (number of students) are clear and legible. The values are directly placed on top of each bar, making it easy to read the exact numbers. The title is descriptive and provides context for the data.

Model: gpt-4o-mini
Readability Score: 2/5
Score Reason: The chart presents the data in a bar format, which is generally effective for comparison. However, the use of diagonal lines within the bars makes it difficult to accurately gauge the heights of the bars, leading to potential misinterpretation of the data. Additionally, the numbers on top of the bars are not clearly visible due to the lack of contrast with the background. Overall, while the structure is sound, the execution hinders readability.
