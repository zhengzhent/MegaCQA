Model: Qwen/Qwen2.5-VL-72B-Instruct
Readability Score: 5/5
Score Reason: The chart is clear and well-organized, with each city's student population easily distinguishable by the height of the bars. The use of a gradient color scheme adds visual interest without detracting from the data. The labels are legible, and the values are directly placed on top of the bars, making it straightforward to interpret the data at a glance.

Model: gpt-4o-mini
Readability Score: 4/5
Score Reason: The visualization effectively uses a bar chart to compare the number of students across different cities. The labels are clear, and the color gradient helps in distinguishing the bars. However, the numbers on top of the bars could be more legible if they were in a contrasting color. Overall, the chart is easy to interpret, but minor improvements could enhance readability.
