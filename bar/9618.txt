Model: Qwen/Qwen2.5-VL-72B-Instruct
Readability Score: 4/5
Score Reason: The chart is relatively simple with clear labels and a straightforward layout. The gradient color adds a visual appeal but does not contribute to the data interpretation. The months are not in chronological order, which might cause a slight confusion. However, the values are clearly marked on top of each bar, making it easy to understand the sales figures for each month.

The use of a gradient color scheme is visually appealing, but it may slightly detract from the clarity of the data representation.
