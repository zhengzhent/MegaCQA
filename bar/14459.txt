Model: gpt-4o-mini
Readability Score: 4/5
Score Reason: The chart effectively uses color to differentiate between the farms, and the bar heights clearly represent the transportation flow in tons. The labels are legible, and the values are displayed on top of the bars, making it easy to interpret the data at a glance. However, the rotation of the x-axis labels may slightly hinder readability for some viewers.
