Model: Qwen/Qwen2.5-VL-72B-Instruct
Readability Score: 4/5
Score Reason: The bar chart is clear and straightforward, with each bar representing a company and its number of employees. The labels are legible, and the values are directly written on top of each bar, making it easy to compare the number of employees across different companies. The use of a grid pattern in the bars adds a visual texture but does not detract from the readability.

Model: gpt-4o-mini
Readability Score: 4/5
Score Reason: The chart presents the data clearly with distinct bars for each company, and the numerical values are labeled directly on the bars, which aids in quick comprehension. However, the use of a grid pattern within the bars may distract from the actual data representation. Overall, the chart is fairly easy to read, but the grid pattern slightly detracts from clarity.
