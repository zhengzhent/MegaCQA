--------------------------------------------------
Model: Qwen/Qwen2.5-VL-72B-Instruct
Readability Score: 4/5
Score Reason: The chart is well-organized with clear labels and distinct colors for each energy source. The values are directly written on top of each bar, making it easy to read the exact consumption figures. The title and axes are clearly labeled, which helps in understanding the context of the data. However, the bar for 'Electricity' is significantly taller than the others, which might make it a bit harder to compare the smaller values.

Model: gpt-4o-mini
Readability Score: 4/5
Score Reason: The visualization effectively presents energy consumption data with clear labels and a straightforward bar chart format. However, the extremely high value for Geothermal compared to other energy sources may overshadow the smaller values, making it harder to compare them visually. Despite this, the overall layout is clean and the colors are distinct, allowing for reasonable readability.
