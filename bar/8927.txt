Model: gpt-4o-mini
Readability Score: 4/5
Score Reason: The visualization presents the data in a clear horizontal bar chart format, making it easy to compare the house sales of different types. The use of distinct colors for each bar helps in differentiating the categories, and the labels are legible. However, the chart could benefit from a more organized layout, as some bars are quite close together, which may lead to slight confusion in reading the values. Overall, it is still quite readable.
