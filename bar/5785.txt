Readability Score: 4/5

Model: gpt-4o-mini
Readability Score: 4/5
Score Reason: The visualization effectively uses horizontal bars to represent sales figures, making it easy to compare different food categories. However, the use of diagonal lines within the bars can create some visual clutter, and the numbers at the end of the bars are not clearly aligned, which may lead to misinterpretation. Overall, it is fairly readable but could be improved.
