Model: Qwen/Qwen2.5-VL-72B-Instruct
Readability Score: 4/5
Score Reason: The chart uses distinct colors for each month, which helps in distinguishing the data visually. The labels are clear and the values are directly written on the bars, making it easy to read the exact figures. The title is descriptive and the axis labels are straightforward. However, the months are not in chronological order, which might cause a slight confusion for the reader.

The color differentiation is clear, and the labels are legible. However, the chart could benefit from a more consistent color scheme and clearer axis labeling to enhance overall readability.
