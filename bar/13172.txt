Model: Qwen/Qwen2.5-VL-72B-Instruct
Readability Score: 4/5
Score Reason: The chart is clear and well-organized, with distinct colors for each bar that make it easy to differentiate between attractions. The labels are legible, and the values are directly placed on top of each bar, which aids in quick comprehension. However, the bar for 'Whisper Reef' is significantly taller than the others, which might make it slightly challenging to compare the smaller values at a glance.

Model: gpt-4o-mini
Readability Score: 4/5
Score Reason: The visualization is clear and effectively uses color to differentiate between the attractions. The labels are legible, and the scale is appropriate for the data presented. However, the large discrepancy in visitor numbers, particularly with Willow Reef, may distract from the overall comparison of the other attractions. Despite this, the chart remains easy to read and interpret.
