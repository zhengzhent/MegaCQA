Readability Score: 4/5
Score Reason: The chart presents the data in a clear bar format, with well-labeled axes and a straightforward title. The use of numerical values on the bars allows for easy comparison of visitor numbers across attractions. However, the lack of color differentiation and the crowded appearance of the bars may slightly hinder readability. Overall, it is still quite easy to interpret the data.
