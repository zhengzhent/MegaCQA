Model: Qwen/Qwen2.5-VL-72B-Instruct
Readability Score: 4/5
Score Reason: The chart is clear and well-organized, with each city's bar distinctly separated and labeled. The use of diagonal lines within the bars adds a visual texture without cluttering the chart. The numbers of artworks are clearly indicated at the end of each bar, making it easy to compare the quantities at a glance. The axis labels and title are legible and provide necessary context.

Model: gpt-4o-mini
Readability Score: 4/5
Score Reason: The visualization effectively uses horizontal bars to represent the number of artworks created in different cities, making it easy to compare values at a glance. The labels for both the cities and the numbers are clear and legible. However, the use of hatched patterns instead of solid colors may slightly detract from clarity, but overall, the chart remains easy to interpret.
