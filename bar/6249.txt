Model: Qwen/Qwen2.5-VL-72B-Instruct
Readability Score: 4/5
Score Reason: The chart is clear and well-organized, with each bar representing a town's hospital visits. The use of a gradient color scheme adds visual interest without detracting from the data. The labels for both the x-axis (town names) and y-axis (number of visits) are legible, and the exact number of visits is displayed on top of each bar, making it easy to interpret the data at a glance.

Model: gpt-4o-mini
Readability Score: 4/5
Score Reason: The visualization effectively uses a bar chart format to display hospital visit data across different towns. The color gradient provides a clear visual distinction between the bars, and the numerical values on top of each bar enhance understanding. However, the chart could benefit from clearer labeling of the y-axis and a more distinct color contrast to improve readability further.
