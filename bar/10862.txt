Readability Score: 4/5
Score Reason: The chart is clear and well-organized, with distinct colors for each city's bar, making it easy to differentiate between them. The labels are legible, and the values are directly placed on top of each bar, which aids in quick comprehension. The title and axis labels are also clear and informative.

Model: gpt-4o-mini
Readability Score: 4/5
Score Reason: The chart effectively presents the data with clear labels for each city and a straightforward y-axis indicating investment amounts. However, the use of decimal points for some values while others are whole numbers may create inconsistency. Additionally, the color scheme is somewhat muted, which could make it harder for some viewers to distinguish between the bars. Overall, the chart is readable but could benefit from improved color contrast and consistent number formatting.
