Model: gpt-4o-mini
Readability Score: 4/5
Score Reason: The visualization is clear and effectively uses a horizontal bar chart to display the production of different crops. The labels are easy to read, and the color gradient helps to differentiate the values. However, the scale of the peanut crop is significantly larger than the others, which may distract from the overall comparison. Despite this, the chart remains understandable and conveys the information well.
