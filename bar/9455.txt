Model: Qwen/Qwen2.5-VL-72B-Instruct
Readability Score: 4/5
Score Reason: The chart uses a clear and straightforward horizontal bar format, with distinct colors for each month, which helps in differentiating the data. The labels are legible, and the values are directly placed on the bars, making it easy to understand the sales figures at a glance. However, the months are not in chronological order, which might cause a slight confusion for the reader.

Model: gpt-4o-mini
Readability Score: 4/5
Score Reason: The visualization effectively uses horizontal bars to represent monthly sales figures, making it easy to compare values across different months. The color coding is distinct and helps in differentiating the months. However, the y-axis labels could be clearer, as the month names are not aligned with the bars, which may cause slight confusion. Overall, the chart is mostly readable with minor improvements needed.
