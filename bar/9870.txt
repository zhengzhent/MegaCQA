Model: Qwen/Qwen2.5-VL-72B-Instruct
Readability Score: 4/5
Score Reason: The chart is clear and well-organized, with distinct colors for each bar that make it easy to differentiate between months. The values are directly labeled on top of each bar, which enhances readability. However, the months are not in chronological order, which might cause a slight confusion for the reader when trying to understand the trend over time.
