Model: Qwen/Qwen2.5-VL-72B-Instruct
Readability Score: 4/5
Score Reason: The chart is well-organized with clear labels for each farm and the corresponding fruit transportation flow in tons. The use of distinct colors for each bar helps in distinguishing the farms easily. The values are directly written on top of each bar, which makes it easy to read the exact numbers. However, the large difference in values, especially the outlier 'Cedar Farm', makes it a bit challenging to compare the smaller values effectively.
