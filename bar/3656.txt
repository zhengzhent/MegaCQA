Model: Qwen/Qwen2.5-VL-72B-Instruct
Readability Score: 4/5
Score Reason: The chart is clear and well-organized, with each city's student population represented by a distinct bar. The use of diagonal lines for shading adds a visual texture without cluttering the chart. The labels are legible, and the values are directly placed at the end of each bar, making it easy to compare the number of students across different cities. The title and axis labels are clear and informative.

Model: gpt-4o-mini
Readability Score: 4/5
Score Reason: The visualization effectively uses horizontal bars to compare the number of students across different cities, which is a clear and intuitive format. However, the use of hatched patterns instead of solid colors can make it harder to distinguish between the bars, especially for those with color vision deficiencies. The numerical values next to the bars are helpful, but the overall readability is slightly compromised by the patterns used.
