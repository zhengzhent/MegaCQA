Model: gpt-4o-mini
Readability Score: 4/5
Score Reason: The visualization is clear and well-structured, with distinct colors for each company that help differentiate the data. The labels for both the companies and the number of employees are legible, and the y-axis is appropriately scaled. However, the chart could benefit from a more consistent color scheme and possibly a legend to enhance clarity further. Overall, it effectively communicates the data.
