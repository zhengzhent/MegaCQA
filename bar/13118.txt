Model: gpt-4o-mini
Readability Score: 4/5
Score Reason: The chart effectively uses distinct colors for each bar, making it easy to differentiate between the attractions. The labels are clear and the scale is appropriate for the data presented. However, the rotation of the x-axis labels makes them slightly harder to read, which could be improved. Overall, the visualization is mostly clear and conveys the information well.
