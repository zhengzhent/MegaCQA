--------------------------------------------------
Model: Qwen/Qwen2.5-VL-72B-Instruct
Readability Score: 4/5
Score Reason: The chart is straightforward and uses clear labels for both the x-axis and y-axis. The values are directly written on top of each bar, which makes it easy to read the exact production numbers. The use of a single pattern for all bars keeps the chart simple and avoids unnecessary complexity. The title clearly states the purpose of the chart, which is to show the production of different crops in metric tons.

Model: gpt-4o-mini
Readability Score: 4/5
Score Reason: The chart effectively presents the production of different crops with clear labels and a straightforward layout. The use of distinct bars for each crop category allows for easy comparison, and the numerical values displayed on top of the bars enhance clarity. However, the lack of color differentiation and the use of hatching may slightly reduce visual appeal, but it does not significantly hinder readability.
