Model: Qwen/Qwen2.5-VL-72B-Instruct
Readability Score: 4/5
Score Reason: The chart is well-organized with clear labels and a straightforward layout. The use of consistent patterns for the bars helps in distinguishing them, and the numerical values are directly placed at the end of each bar, making it easy to read the exact sales figures. The title and axis labels are clear and informative.

Model: gpt-4o-mini
Readability Score: 4/5
Score Reason: The chart presents the sales figures clearly with distinct categories and corresponding values. However, the use of hatching instead of solid colors may reduce clarity, especially for viewers with color vision deficiencies. The axis labels and titles are clear, but the overall readability could be improved with better color choices.
