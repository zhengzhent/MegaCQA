Model: Qwen/Qwen2.5-VL-72B-Instruct
Readability Score: 4/5
Score Reason: The chart is straightforward and uses a clear bar graph format to display the box office earnings of different movies. The bars are evenly spaced, and the values are directly labeled on top of each bar, making it easy to compare the earnings at a glance. The use of a consistent pattern within the bars adds a visual element without cluttering the chart. The axis labels and title are clear and informative.

Model: gpt-4o-mini
Readability Score: 4/5
Score Reason: The chart presents the box office earnings of different movies clearly, with distinct bars for each movie. However, the use of a patterned fill instead of solid colors may make it slightly harder to differentiate between the bars at a glance. The axis labels and titles are clear, but the numbers on top of the bars could be more prominent for better visibility. Overall, it is fairly easy to read but could be improved.
