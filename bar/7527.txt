Model: gpt-4o-mini
Readability Score: 4/5
Score Reason: The visualization effectively uses horizontal bars to represent the number of employees in different companies, making it easy to compare values. The labels are clear and the color gradient helps in distinguishing the bars. However, the highest value is significantly larger than the others, which may create a visual imbalance. Overall, it is still quite readable.
