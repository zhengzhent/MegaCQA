Model: gpt-4o-mini
Readability Score: 4/5
Score Reason: The visualization presents a clear comparison of student numbers across different cities. The use of horizontal bars allows for easy comparison, and the labels are straightforward. However, the hatched pattern on the bars may reduce clarity slightly, making it harder to quickly gauge the values. Overall, it is still quite readable.
