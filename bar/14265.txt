Model: Qwen/Qwen2.5-VL-72B-Instruct
Readability Score: 4/5
Score Reason: The chart is clear and straightforward, with distinct bars for each farm that are easy to differentiate due to the use of diagonal lines. The labels for both the farms and the tonnage are legible, and the values are directly indicated on the bars, making it easy to understand the transportation flow at a glance.

Model: gpt-4o-mini
Readability Score: 4/5
Score Reason: The chart presents the data in a clear bar format, with distinct labels for each farm and corresponding values. However, the use of diagonal lines within the bars may distract from the actual values, making it slightly harder to read at a glance. The overall structure is good, but the design choice affects readability.
