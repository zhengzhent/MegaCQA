Model: Qwen/Qwen2.5-VL-72B-Instruct
Readability Score: 5/5
Score Reason: The chart is straightforward and easy to interpret. The bars are clearly labeled with both the city names and the exact number of artworks. The use of a gradient color scheme adds visual interest without detracting from the clarity. The scale on the y-axis is appropriate for the data range, and the title clearly states the purpose of the chart.

Model: gpt-4o-mini
Readability Score: 4/5
Score Reason: The visualization effectively communicates the number of artworks created across different cities. The bar heights are proportional to the values, and the labels are clear. However, the color gradient may distract some viewers, and the small value for Ashford could be overlooked due to its significantly lower height compared to the other bars. Overall, it is still relatively easy to interpret.
