Model: gpt-4o-mini
Readability Score: 4/5
Score Reason: The visualization presents the data clearly with well-defined bars for each city, and the values are labeled directly on the bars, making it easy to read. The use of a consistent scale on the y-axis allows for straightforward comparisons between cities. However, the striped pattern on the bars may slightly detract from the clarity, but overall, the chart remains quite readable.
